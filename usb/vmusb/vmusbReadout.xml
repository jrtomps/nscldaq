    <para>
        The VMUSB readout framework provides support for the Wiener-JTec
        VM-USB VME controller. The VM-USB is a USB VME controller that uses
        a Xilinx gate array to implement a VME list processor.  This allows
        events to be readout autonomously by the VM-USB without intervention
        by the host processor.
        The VMUSB Readout framework provides:

        <title>How the VMUSB readout framework works</title>
        <para>
            The VM-USB readout framework taks a high level approach to
            specifying and configuring a readout case.   Users write a
            configuration file that specifies at a very high level which
            devices are used, their configuration and which ones need to be
            read under which circumstances (The VM-USB supports up to 8 lists
            with differing trigger conditions).
        </para>
        <para>
            The framework supports data taking (physics and scaler triggers), as
            well as a mechanism for building and integrating control panels
            for slow controls devices.  A plugin architecture supports the addition
            of user support for devices that are not now supported by internal
            drivers.
        </para>
        <para>
            The recurring concepts for configuring data taking and slow controls
            devices are:

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Each supported device class is represented in the
                    configuration file by a Tcl command ensemble. The
                    command ensemble provides subcommands that allow you to
                    create, configure and query the configuration of
                    physical devices (device instances).

                    The device configuration is represented in the configuration
                    file in manner analagous to the state of a Tk widget.
                    That is, you never actually program the device directly,
                    you simply specify the desired configuration. The actual
                    programming is done by the device class's device support
                    software.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In accordance with the way the VM-USB operates, you can create
                    8 lists or <firstterm>stack</firstterm>s in VM-USB parlance.
                    Some of these stacks have special meaning to either the
                    framework or to the VM-USB.  One stack is reserved by the
                    VM-USB as the target of periodic triggers and is used to
                    support scaler readout/display.  A second stack is reserved
                    for a software periodic trigger and is used to support
                    devices that require periodic monitoring (e.g. detector
                    bias supplies which may trip during operation due to interlock
                    conditions).   Of the remaining 6 stacks one can be triggered
                    by a VM-USB front panel input and the remaining 5 can
                    be triggered by VME backplane interrupts.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Each stack has, configuration properties as well. One
                    configuration property is the set of modules managed
                    by that stack.  Modules managed by that stack are initialized
                    by the software, in accordance with their configuration,
                    and contribute to the readout list that executes in response
                    to that stack's trigger.

        <title>Writing DAQ configuration files</title>
        <para>
            The DAQ configuration file is processed at the beginning of each run.
            The configuration file is processed in a fresh interpreter each time.
            You therefore cannot maintain any state across runs via your configuration
            file.
        </para>
        <para>
            To illustrate module creation and configuration,
            this let's look at a fragment from a configuration
            file:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Creating and configuring devices</title>
            <programlisting>
adc create myadc 0x11000000
adc config myadc -geo 15
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The <command>adc</command> command implements base support for the
            CAEN 32 channel digitizer family (V775, V785, V792, V862).  The first
            command creates an instance of one of those modules with a base address
            <literal>0x11000000</literal>.  The instance is given the name
            <literal>myadc</literal> to distinguish it from other digitizers
            of that or other types.
        </para>
        <para>
            The second line sets a configuration parameter, the geographical
            address of the  module, for the instance created by the first line.
            Each device type supports a set of configuration parameters much in the
            same way Tk objects support configuration options.
            The reference ssection <literal>3vmusb</literal> provides detailed
            information about the configuration options supported by each
            device class.
        </para>
        <para>
            Configuration files must also specify at least one stack and, if
            scaler modules are to be read periodically, a second scaler stack.
            See the <xref linkend="ccusb3-stack" /> command
            in the reference material for detailed information about how
            to create and configure stacks.
        </para>
        <para>
            To continue with the previous example:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Configuring an event stack</title>
            <programlisting>
stack create events
stack config event -trigger nim1 -modules [myadc]
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            Stacks are created and configured exactly like any other module.
            In this configuration file fragment, a stack named
            <literal>events</literal> is created.  It is configured to
            manage the <literal>myadc</literal> module (<option>-modules</option>).
            It is configured to use the IN 1 input of the VM-USB
            (<literal>-trigger nim1</literal>) to trigger the stack.
        </para>
        <para>
            Finally here is a configuration file fragment that sets up an
            SIS 3820 scaler and a scaler stack to read it every 2 seconds:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Configuring a VM-USB scaler stack</title>
            <programlisting>
sis3820 create sisscaler 0x38000000

stack create scaler 
stack config scaler -modules [list sisscaler] -trigger scaler -period 2
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The reference pages in <literal>3vmusb</literal> describe, among other
            things the commands that implement device support that are supported
            by the NSCL programming group.  In addtion to user device drivers
            that are described later in this chapter, two device drivers support
            modules have been contributed by Washington University at St. Louis.
            These modules support XLMs used to read out the ASIC systems they
            have developed for managing large detector arrays.
        </para>
        <para>
            For information about how to use those modules, contact
            Lee Sobotka or Jon Elson at Washington University directly.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Writing C++ device support software</title>
        <para>
            This section describes how to write C++ software support for new
            data taking devices and how to integrate that support into the
            system.  Device support modules are built into shared images.
            Tcl provides the <command>load</command> command which loads
            a shared object into an application and invokes an initialization
            function.  This provicdes a plugin scheme that the framework
            leverages to support externally written device drivers.
        </para>
        <para>
            A device driver therefore consists of a C++ program that provides
            a new device class and an initialization function that associates
            this class with a Tcl command in the interpreter that reads the
            configuration file.  Since each time the configuration file is read,
            a new interpreter is used, this also means that the current version
            of the device driver shared image is loaded at the start of each
            run.
        </para>
        <para>
            The device driver support package is supplied as a driver development
            kit that consists of a template driver and a Makefile.  These are two
            files in the <filename>vmusbdriver</filename> directory of the
            NSCLDAQ installation.  The example below shows how to create
            a new directory and prepare it for driver development.  In the example
            we are assuming that the environment variable <literal>DAQROOT</literal>
            points to the top level of the installation directory.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Obtaning the VM-USB device driver development kit</title>
            <programlisting>
mkdir mydriver
cd mydriver
cp $DAQROOT/vmusbdriver/drivertemplate.cpp .
cp $DAQROOT/vmusbdriver/Makefile .
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The template driver is a complete example that builds a
            marker driver which inserts  constant word into the event.
            You can do a <command>make</command> to build the driver if you like.
            The template driver then defines a command <command>changeme</command>
            for the configuration file interpreter and a configuration parameter
            <option>-value</option> which allows you to set the value of the
            markrer.
        </para>
        <para>
            The script fragment below shows how to load the driver, create and
            configure a module instance using it. The fragment assumes that the
            driver shared object <filename>libtemplatedriver.so</filename>
            is in the same directory as the DAQ configuration script but that
            that directory my not be the current working directory when
            the configuration script is sourced.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Using a user written VMUSB driver</title>
            <programlisting>
set here [file nativename [file dirname [info script]]]
load [file join $here libtemplatedriver.so]
changeme cdreate testing -value -0x1234
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The work done by the <command>set here...</command> command builds
            the full path to the directory the driver is in.  This is necessary
            beause the <command>load</command> command normally only uses directories
            that are in the dynamic loader search path to look for shared objects.
            Note finally that once the driver is loaded, it registers the
            <command>changeme</command> command with the interpreter and that
            this command operates exactly like any other driver command.
        </para>
        <para>
            The next sections will examine the driver elements in detail. Before
            doing that, let's take a broad brush overview look at the driver
            template.
        </para>
        <para>
            The template consists of two sections.  The first section is the
            definition and implementation of a class which derives from
            <classname>CReadoutHardware</classname> the base class for
            all DAQ device support.  The methods of this class define
            configuration parameters, initialize the module as the run
            is starting and provides the appropriate commands to the
            VME list that is being generated for the stack this module
            is an element of.  Finally virtual duplication
            (<methodname>clone</methodname>) is also defined.
        </para>
        <para>
            The second section  is an initialization
            function that the Tcl <command>load</command> command automatically
            locates and calls.  This function creates an instance of the
            driver which is cloned for each device instance the user creates.
            It also associates a Tcl command with the device driver so that
            the DAQ configuration script can create and manipulate new instances.
        </para>
        <para>
            While the driver template is heavily commmented, and modification
            points indicated, the next few sectinos are a guided tour
            of the driver in detail, pointing out what needs to be modified
            to make the driver work with a specific device.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>The driver <methodname>onAttach</methodname> method</title>
            <para>
                Each driver instance has a configuration database attached to it
                when it is created.  The configuration database holds configuration
                parameter definitions and their current values.  The framework
                takes care of managing the values for you, however you must
                define the set of configuration parameters supported by your
                driver.
            </para>
            <para>
                The template driver's code is (comments removed for brevity:
            </para>

                        Most if not all VME modules must be addressed relative
                        to some base address that is set via jumpers or switches
                        on the module itself.  Therefore the template driver
                        provides a definition for a <option>-base</option>
                        option to hold this value.  The specific version of
                        <methodname>addIntegerParameter</methodname> used
                        only requires that the value passed to <option>-base</option>
                        be a valid integer.  No constraint on the range is

            <para>
                When a run is starting, each stack invokes the
                <methodname>Initialize</methodname> method for each element in
                its <option>-modules</option> list.  Each driver is supposed
                to query its configuration and do any initialization demanded
                by the configuration.  For example the <command>adc</command>
                command queries the set of pedestal values and programs them
                into its module (using the <option>-base</option> of course)
                at this time.
            </para>
            <para>
                The <methodname>Initialize</methodname> method is passed a
                reference to a <classname>CVMUSB</classname> object.  Methods
                on that object allow you to perform single or block VME
                operations.  You can also create and stock a
                <classname>CVMUSBReadoutList</classname> with several VME
                operations and ask the controller to execute that list in
                immediate mode.

                The template driver is a marker and does not perform any
                VME operations.  Since, however your driver will most likely
                need the <option>-base</option> parameter value, it shows
                how to obtain that from the configuration database:

            <para>
                The configuration database stores all parameter values as
                strings after validating them however it also provides a rich
                set of member function to convert the string to some other
                format.  Since the <option>-base</option> parameter can take values
                greater than <literal>0x80000000</literal> it must be converted
                and treated as an unsigned integer.
                <methodname>getUnsignedParameter</methodname> converts the
                value of the configuration parameter given to an unsigned integer.

            <command>addReadoutList</command> which perform functions
            analagous to methods with the same name in a C++ driver.
        </para>
        <para>
            Possibly the simplest way to build command ensembles that can be
            re-used to support more than one module is to use a
            Tcl object oriented extension.  When you do this, a driver
            is a class and instances of those classes are modules.  Almost all
            Tcl object oriented extensions make objects (class instances) command
            ensembles where the base name is the object names and methods of the
            class are  subcommands.

        <para>
            Driver modules will also need to access the VM-USB during
            initialization and create lists of VME operations in their
            <methodname>addReadoutList</methodname> method.  This
            is accomplished by wrappgin the <classname>CVMUSB</classname>
            and <classname>CVMUSBReadoutList</classname> classes using the
            <firstterm>Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator</firstterm> or
            SWIG.  SWIG wrappers are provided as loadable Tcl modules in the
            <filename>lib</filename> directory of the NSCLDAQ software
            installation.

            This chapter will look at two trivial drivers that put a
            marker in the buffer and, at initialization time, turn on the
            bottom yellow LED.  One of these drivers is written using
            <firstterm>Incr-Tcl</firstterm> (itcl) the other using
            <firstterm>Snit Is Not Incr Tcl</firstterm> (snit).
            While trivial these examples illustrate most of the
            key concepts you need to understand when writing device support
            software in Tcl.

                Snit is a pure Tcl object oriented extension to Tcl. In this
                section we will look at an annotated sample Snit Tcl driver.
                The sample driver will just turn on the VM-USB's bottom yellow
                LED at initialization time and inserts a configurable marker into
                each event in response to a trigger.

            <para>
                While this driver is realtively trivial, it illustrates many
                of the key points you will need to understand to write Tcl
                drivers in snit.  If you have looked at the Incr-Tcl driver
                in the previous section there will be very little that is new
                here other than Snit syntactical differences from Incr-Tcl.

        <title> The slow controls subsystem</title>
        <para>
        </para>
       <para>
            There is nothing to stop you from creating device support that
            does not do anything in its <methodname>addReadoutList</methodname>.
            You could do this to implement static controls devices.  That is
            non data taking devices whose configuration is set up at the start of
            a run and cannot be dynamically modified.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are cases, however when you'd like to have some control
            panel associated with a device, that would provide a virtual knob
            allowing you to dynamically modify settings in the device.
            The slow controls subsystem supports this by offering a
            TCP/IP server which can accept commands to set and query
            devices.  
        </para>
        <para>
            If the run is halted, the slow controls server can directly
            manipulate the VMUSB to perform the desired device changes.
            If, however the VMUSB is in data taking mode, the slow controls
            server pauses the run, makes the setting and then resumes the run.
            You should avoid working with control panels during production runs
            for that reason.
        </para>
        <para>
            The philosophy of the slow controls subsystem is similar to that
            of the readout subsystem.  A controls configuration file defines
            the control modules present in the system and their unchanging
            configuration.  Note that the controls configuration file
            is read only as VMUSBReadout starts, not once per run as
            for the data acquisition configuration file.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <command>Module</command> command is used to create configure
            and query the configuration of slow controls devices known to the server.
            The following fragment from a controls configuration file

            The slow controls network protocol allows clients to connect
            to a Tcp/IP port and perform requests that are dispatched to
            specific drivers.  The <option>--port</option> option
            specifies the port number on which this Tcip/IP server is listening.

            Drivers have entry points to get and set values as well as
            to update their understanding of the state of the device.
            In addition a mechanism exists that allows drivers to periodically
            poll devices for status without pausing data taking.  This is done
            by providing a monitor list which is programmatically triggered
            on a periodic basis.

		  Contains the actual code to translate Set, Get, Update

		  Drivers are classes that are derived from

		  which provides support for an option configuration database much like

	  These three bits of code must be compiled and linked together into a
	  shared object.  The resulting shared object must have no dangling external
	  references outside of the VMUSBReadout program or else it cannot be loaded
	  by the Tcl server's interpreter.
	</para>
	<para>
	  What I mean by a dangling reference is best illustrated by an example.
	  Suppose you need the function <function>crypt</function> in your driver
	  (<command>man crypt</command> to know what that does).  That function
	  lives in the <filename>libcrypt</filename> library.  For a library intended 
	  to be linked into other code to make a complete program, it's not necessary
	  for your libarary to link explicitly to <filename>libcrypt</filename> so long
	  as the program itself is linke to <filename>libcrypt</filename>.
	  For a shared library used as a slow control driver, however no expclicitly
	  linking it to <filename>libcrypt</filename> would leave an undefined reference
	  that Tcl would not know how to satisfy, so the <command>load</command> of the
	  library would fail.

	  <title>Driver requirements</title>
	  <para>
	    A Slow controls device driver is a class that is derived from
	    the 
	    <link linkend='vmusb3_ccontrolhardware' 
		  endterm='vmusb3_ccontrolhardware_title' /> abstract base class.
	    In this section I will briefly go over the mandatory and optional 
	    requirements of a driver class as well as providing an annotated
	    sample (if silly) driver.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <link linkend='vmusb3_ccontrolhardware' 
		  endterm='vmusb3_ccontrolhardware_title' /> class is an abstract
	    base class.  This means it has some virtual methods that are not 
	    implemented and must be implemented by derived classes.
	    In addition the name of the object being created (<command>Module</command>
	    command's name) is maintained by the base class.  
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    These constraints mean that a control driver class must implement the
	    following member functions.

	  <variablelist>
	    <varlistentry>
	      <term>constructor</term>

		  <methodname>onAttach</methodname> is called when the driver's

		  <parameter>configuration</parameter> can be stored for future use.
		</para>
		<para>
		  The <methodname>onAttach</methodname> method is also where you must
		  define your configuration options and their constraints.  Soon after this
		  method is invoked, the driver is likely to have to respond to 
		  requests to configure values into these parameters.
		  As with readout drivers, the process of giving values to configuration
		  options transparent to your driver code.  When you need to know the

		<para>
		  For some devices, the ability set and get parameters is not the whole story. 
		  This is especially the case because in order to set or get a parameter, active data taking must
		  be stopped and restarted which is time-consuming.  Consider, for example, a VME Bias supply
		  controller.  A control panel would want to monitor the supply for trips periodically and display
		  those trips regardless of whether or not data taking is active.  This  is accomplisshed with
		  a monitor list.
		</para>
		<para>
		  The monitor list is one of the 8 stacks supported by the VM-USB.  It contains a set of operations
		  that are periodically performed by manually triggering the list in the action register.  The
		  data routing software forwards data from this list to the Tcl server for processing.  Since this list
		  can be triggered just like any other acquisition mode list, no time consuming stop/start is needed
		  when data taking is active.  If data taking is inactive the list is periodically issued as an
		  immediate mode list.
		</para>
		<para>
		  <methodname>addMonitorList</methodname> provides an opportunity for a driver to specify a set

	    Let's look at the code for a rather silly user written driver a piece at a time.

	    <option>-astring</option> which holds an arbitraty string, and 
	    <option>-alist</option> which holds a list of integers.
	    The Set and Get operations will modify and retrieve these options.

	    <para>
	      The key points are that the user driver inherits from the
	      <classname>CControlHardware</classname> base class. Since
	      <classname>CControlHardware</classname> is an abstract base class,
	      it is necessary to define all abstract methods.  Furthermore, since
	      <classname>CControlHardware</classname> has no default constructor,
	      our driver must define a constructor that is capable of passing the
	      driver instance name (module name) to the base class.

{}
	      </programlisting>
	    </example>
	    <para>
	      The only mandatory function of the constructor is to provide the
	      instance <parameter>name</parameter> to the base class.  The
	      instance name is the name provided to the <command>Module create</command>.
	      Naturally if the driver has internal instance data that requires
	      initialization, the constructor is where this should be done.

	      Some devices have write only registers.  Since it is not possible
	      to determine the device state by reading the device registers, it is
	      useful to have an operation that will set the device to a known state.
	      Typcially this state is maintained in a set of <firstterm>shadow registers</firstterm>
	      that are maintained in the driver instance,and possibly read from a

	<para>
	  The <methodname>Initialize</methodname> does nothing for our driver.

	  of the hardware as well as other static configuration options.  The

        <para>
            The <methodname>Update</methodname> method servesthe same function
            in a Tcl driver as in a C++ driver.  In our case the implementationis
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Tcl control driver <methodname>Update</methodname> method</title>

    method Update vme {

        <para>
            The <parameter>vme</parameter> is a SWIG encapsulated
            <classname>CVMUSB</classname> object that, in a real driver,
            would be used to perform VME operations or execute lists created
            via  <classname>CVMUSBReadoutList</classname> objects created and
            filled in by this method.
        </para>
        <para>
            The return string of <literal>OK</literal> indicates a normal
            completion.  Tcl methods have two mechanisms to return errors.
            Returning a string that begins with <literal>ERROR - </literal>
            and concludes with an error message, or simply executing the
            <command>error</command> with an error message argument.
            The wrapper will map error returns into an <literal>ERROR - </literal>
            string return with the value of the string passed t the
            <command>error</command> command appended to the end of the
            error return string.
        </para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>The Set method</title>
        <para>
            As with the C++ driver, the <methodname>Set</methodname> method is
            used to process client requests to change a device parameter.
            The Tcl version of this method is:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Tcl control driver <methodname>Set</methodname> method</title>
            <programlisting>
    method Set {vme parameter value} {
        $self configure $parameter $value
        return "OK"
    }
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The parameters passed into this are the same as those passed into
            a C++ driver's set, however the <parameter>vme</parameter> parameter
            is a swig wrapped <classname>CVMUSB</classname> object.
        </para>
        <para>
            By using the <methodname>configure</methodname> method rather than
            just directly writing to the <varname>options</varname> array
            we force the call of any <option>-configuremethod</option> code
            that may do validations and throw errors.
        </para>
        <para>
            The return of <literal>OK</literal> indicates successful completion,
            an error will be converted by the wrapper into a return string of the form
            <literal>ERROR - </literal><replaceable>intepreter error result string</replaceable>.
            This allows errors from the <methodname>configurmethod</methodname>,
            including specifying an invalid option name as well as failures
            in validation by the <option>-configuremethod</option> code to be
            naturally mapped back to proper error returns.
        </para>
        <para>
            In a real driver, the <parameter>vme</parameter> parameter will
            be used to perform VME operations.  In addition you can choose
            to explicitly return an error string, or use the
            <command>error</command> command to report failures.
        </para>

      <section>
        <title>The Get method</title>
        <para>
            As with the C++ driver this is called to fetch the value of a
            driver parameter.  Our toy driver fetches configuration parameters
            rather than hardware parameters.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Tcl control driver <methodname>Get</methodname> method</title>
            <programlisting>
    method Get {vme parameter} {
        if {[array names options $parameter] eq ""} {
            error "Invalid parameter name: $parameter"
        }
        return $options($parameter)
    }
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            Our driver ensures the value of <parameter>parameter</parameter> really
            is an option name and then returns the option value from the
            <varname>options</varname> array.
            By doing the check for <command>array names options $parameter</command>
            we can produce a more meaningful error message than would be
            produced if we just let <command>return $options($parameter)</command>
            error.
        </para>
        <para>
            Instead of the <command>error</command> command we could have just
            as easily done a <command>return "ERROR - Invalid parameter name: $parameter"</command>
        </para>
        <para>
            A real driver would use the <parameter>vme</parameter> parameter,
            which is a Swig wrapped <classname>CVMUSB</classname> object
            to fetch the value of the parameter from the hardware.

      <section>
	<title>The addMonitorList method</title>
	<para>
	  Since we are not using monitor lists, this method is trivial:

	  <title>Tcl control drer <methodname>addMonitorList</methodname> method</title>
	  <programlisting>
    method addMonitorList vmeList {
    }
	  </programlisting>
	</example>
	<para>
	  The <parameter>vmeList</parameter> is a <classname>CVMEReadoutList</classname>
	  that is wrapped by Swig.  A driver that uses monitor lists would add operations
	  to the list as needed to retrieve the data being monitored from the device.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>The processMonitorList method</title>
	<para>
	  <methodname>processMonitorList</methodname> is called with the data read
	  by the monitor list marshalled into a Tcl list of bytes (string representation).
	  The method is expected to process what it needs from the front of the list
	  and return a count of the number of bytes processed.  Since we are not using
	  monitor lists, our implementation is:
	</para>
	<example>
	  <title>Tcl control driver <methodname>processMonitorList</methodname> method</title>
	  <programlisting>
    method processMonitorList data {
        return 0
    }
	  </programlisting>
	</example>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>The getMonitoredData method</title>
	<para>
	  If using a monitor list, this method typically returns the data
	  last processed by <methodname>processMonitorList</methodname> with
	  <literal>OK - </literal> prepended to indicate a successful completion.
	  As usual an <command>error</command> or script errors will result in
	  a return of <literal>ERROR - </literal> with the result string appended.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Since we are not using a monitor list, it's appropriate for us
	  to return an error condition:
	</para>
	<example>
	  <title>Tcl control driver <methodname>getMonitoredData</methodname> method</title>
	  <programlisting>
    method getMonitoredData {} {
        error "This driver has no monitored data"
    }

	</example>

	  <methodname>_validInd</methodname> and <methodname>_validIntList</methodname>.
	</para>
	<note><title>Note</title>
	<para>
	  Snit does not have method visibility control, that is all methods
	  are public.   By convention, methods that are not intended to be
	  called by a client are given names that start with a <literal>_</literal>.
	  Therefore these methods should be considered private.

        <para>
            The slow controls port can also be used to send data that will
            be periodically inserted in the data stream.  The mechanism
            for this is intended to monitor slowly varying values (for example
            magnet currents).  Here's a brief sketch about how this works:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>
                In your slow controls configuration file you specify Tcl

                A slow controls client sets those variables to value that

            <para>
                The key to monitoring variables is that the control server is
                really a Tcl interpreter executing commands that are poked into
                it by its client sockets.  The Tcl server supports a new
                command <command>watch</command> which allows you to specify
                which variables should be monitored.

     <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
     <para>
	This command creates, configures and retrieves the configuration of
        CAEN V775, V785, V792, and V862, V965 digitizer modules.
     </para>
     <para>
         Use the <command>create</command> subcommand to create a new adc
         providing it with a unique <parameter>name</parameter> that will
         be used to identify it in future commands.  The <parameter>base</parameter>
         parameter is the base address of the module as set in the module rotary
         switches.
     </para>
      <para>
         Use the <command>config</command> subcommand to configure
         a module named <parameter>name</parameter>  the <parameter>option</parameter>
         options and legal values are described in the section OPTIONS below.
      </para>
      <para>
         The <command>cget</command> subcommand returns as its value the configuration
         of the module <parameter>name</parameter>.  The configuration is
         returned as a list of two element sublists where each sublist
         contains, in order, an option from OPTIONS below, and its value.
         Note that some values may themselves be lists.
      </para>
      <para>
        When used with the CAEN V965 or other dual range digitizers via the
	caenv956 command, each parameter specified in the <varname>adcChannels</varname>
	array will result in two SpecTcl channels and corresponding raw spectra.
	The first will have
	<literal>.h</literal> appended to the name and will be the high range
	conversion while the second will have <literal>.l</literal> appended to the
	name and will be the low range value.

                  Defines how many events the module should accumulate before

                  The default value is 24 evetns.  This is best suited for
                  singles applications where allowing the module to accumulate
                  a few events before being read is a good thing.
                  This value will be ignored if the <option>-ipl</option> option
                  has been configured to zero as that also disables module interrupts.

        <para>
            The CAEN family of 32 channel digitizers (V775, V785, V792, V862)
            can be aggreaged into CBLT readout chains.  A CBLT readout chain can
            then be read at high performance using a single block read operation.
        </para>
        <para>
            A CBLT chain consists of a set of at least two modules in consecutive
            VME bus slots.  From the point of view of defining the crate the
            left most and right most modules are special.  (See OPTIONS below,
            the <option>-module</option> option). 
        </para>
        <para>
            CBLT chains require an additional base address that is used to read
            the modules.  This address is also used as a multicast address to
            do a simultaneous clear of all modules in the chain as the readout
            is initialized (at the beginning of a run).

               CBLT readouts always will go from left to right in VME crate. I therefore
               suggest that you supply the modules in left to right order.
               The modules must be a valid TCL list, e.g.:
               <literal>-modules [list adc1 adc2 adc3]</literal> is ok,
               <literal>-modules adc1 adc2 adc3</literal> is not.

                The <command>vmusb</command> command can be used in the

                the internal reasources of the VM-USB as well as to enable
                the readout of its pair of scalers.  The VM-USB provides two outputs
                named O1 and O2 as well as a pair of gate and delay generators
                (DGGA and DGGB), and scalers A and B. Four LEDs round out the

              <para>
                In order to use a vmusb module to configure the controller, you
                must include it in a stack, even if you are not using reading the
                scalers in the VM-USB.  This is because it is the inclusion of
                a module in a stack that causes its initialization methods to
                be invoked, and it is there that teh vmusb module configures
                its resources.

                            Determines size of the internal buffer used by the VMUSB in units of 
                            words. The VMUSB fills the buffer before outputting data on a 
                            usb_bulk_read so a smaller buffer size is useful for low data rates. 
                            The optional values are: 13k, 8k, 4k, 2k, 1k, 512, 256, 128, 64, and evtcount.  
                            The evtcount option depends on the value of the -eventsperbuffer option.
                            The default value is 13k.

                          can be any in the range [1,4095]. The default value is 1.

              <para>
                Provides support for the SIS 3300/3301 flash adc module.
                This is a Tcl driver, hence the need for a
                <command>package require</command> command to load the driver
                and a <command>addtcldriver</command> command to connect
                a driver instance with the framework.
              </para>
              <para>
                The driver support restricting the readout to a subset of the
                channels. See  the <option>-groupsread</option> option for
                more information in OPTIONS below.

           <para>
               Creates and configures the SIS3820 32 channel scaler for use in
               a stack.   The <command>create</command> subcommand creates a new
               module with a base address of <parameter>base</parameter>, and
               a name <parameter>name</parameter> which will be used to refer
               to this module in later configuration commands.
           </para>
            <para>
               The scaler readout will result in an array of 32 channels
               of scaler data placed in the buffer.  The first longword of this
               data is channel 0, the last, channel 1, unless the scaler in in
               <option>-timestamp</option> mode in which case the data are three
               longwords that consist of channel 0, channel 16 and the high bits
               register that has the top 16 bits of each of those channels as
               a 48 bit scaler.
            </para>
            <para>
               The <command>config</command> sub-command configures the options
               for the scaler <parameter>name</parameter>.  The configuration
               is expressed as a series of one or more
               <parameter>option value</parameter> pairs.  Options may have
               default values and are validity checked to ensure that
               valid values are supplied.  See OPTIONS below for more information
               about the option keywords that are supported and their legal values.
            </para>
            <para>
               The <command>cget</command> sub-command returns the current module
               configuration.  The configuration is returned as a Tcl list of
               <parameter>option value</parameter> pairs.  See
               OPTIONS below for a description of the options ans values
               that are returned.  You should not rely on the list being in any
               specific order.  While the list will have a deterministic order,
               if additional option keywords are added later on, this order may
               change.

           <para>
               This command creates, configures and queries the configuration of
               CAEN V830 scaler modules.  This is a latching scaler module.
               At present, not all functionality has been enabled. Specifically,
               the module code is now tailored to the typical use case of a
               run-time scaler module in the scaler stack.
           </para>

           <para>
               The <command>create</command> subcommand creates a new module.
               The <parameter>base</parameter> address should be the VME base
               address of the module, as configured in the module's
               rotary switches.  The <parameter>name</parameter> parameter is
               a name that you assign to the module, and will be used to
               refer to the module in future <command>config</command> or
               <command>cget</command> commands.
            </para>

               The <command>config</command> subcommand configures the module

               set of <parameter>option value</parameter> pairs.  More than one
               pair can appear on the same line, any number of <command>config</command>
               commands can be used and those that execute later can override
               those that execute earlier.
            </para>
            <para>
               The <command>cget</command> subcommand returns the configuration
               of the module <parameter>name</parameter> as a list of
               <parameter>option value</parameter> pairs.  You should not
               rely on the list being in any specific order.  While the list
               order is determinstic within a version of the program it is possible
               that later versions will return the list in a different order.

                     if the MEB is read out.  A value of <literal>true</literal>
                     enables the header while a value of <literal>false</literal> disables it.
                     The default value is <literal>false</literal> which is appropriate
                     for the case where this module will be used in a scaler stack.

This command supports the CAEN V977 I/O register.  At this time support is only
provided to read the module's input register.  Other than setup modes that
echo the inputs to the outputs in some way, output is not supported.

The <command>create</command> subcommand creates a new module.  The <parameter>name</parameter>
parameter supplies a unique name by which that module will be known throughout the
rest of the configuration file.  The optional <parameter>option value</parameter>
pairs provide additional configuration options and can be selected from the
set of configuration options described in OPTIONS below.
	   </para>
	   <para>
The <command>config</command> subcommand allows you to further configure an
existing module.  The <parameter>name</parameter> parameter is the name
you assigned to the module in the <parameter>create</parameter> operation.
The <parameter>option value</parameter> pairs configure the module and can
be selecte from the configuration options described in OPTIONS below.
	   </para>
	   <para>
The <command>cget</command> allows you to retrieve the current configuration of
the module.  The <parameter>name</parameter> parameter provides the name of the module

	   <para>
          Configuration options provide a mechanism to define where a module
			 is located in the VME space as well as how the moduile should be
			 prepared for data taking.  A module is configured via the
			 <command>config</command> subcommand.  That command identifies
			 the module via the name assigned to it in the <command>create</command>
			 operation and provides configuration information in the form of
			 a set of name value pairs.

           <para>
            In situations where an XLM-XXV is not available, Wash-U chip boards
            can be read out using an XLM and an SIS3300/SIS3301 FADC module.
            This command allows you to combine these into a single module.
            from the point of view of a stack.

                  Normally the XLM modules used are either a hinp or psd
                  module.  As the code for these is maintained by Washington
                  Univ,  Those drivers are not documented here.

           <para>
              This command provides support for the Hytec NADC2530.  The NADC2530
              is an 8 channel multi-event peak sensing adc.  While the module
              is capable of autonomously creating histograms, this software does
              not support that capability as it's much easier to treat that
              module differently if used in that way.

	    Beginning with the VM-USB readout program verssion 3.2-001, the
	    software tags the ADC data with a user defined virtual slot number,
	    and the module provides a 48 bit timetamp with each event if
	    its firmware revision is 2530V305 or later.

	       Readout prepends the data from the ADC with three additional

	       event file for this module.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	       The first word of data from this module will be the value of
	       the <option>-id</option> optin.  This defaults to zero if
	       not supplied.  This is followed by a mask word, and then a
	       count word.  These two words allow you to determine the number
	       of longwords of ADC data that follow.
	       </para>
	    <para>
	       Suppose the mask word is <literal>mask</literal> and the
	       count word is <literal>count</literal>.
	       <literal>mask &amp; count</literal> computes the number of longwords
	       of ADC data that follow in the data packet from this module.
	       </para>
	    <para>
	       Following these three words, the data from the ADC as shown in
	       section 4.3.1 of the manual is inserted in the event. Note that:

		     The ADC may convert serveral times for a single channel
		     if multiple signal peaks are detected within the gate

		     When the system starts up, or if the busy lock out logic
		     is not perfect, and allows gates to go to the ADC when
		     the system is busy, you may see additional events or event
		     fragments.  SpecTcl will only pay attention to the data from
		     the first event (it will stop processing channels after the first)
		     trailer word or after the longword count described above is
		     exhausted.

		     When the system initially starts, there may be a large number
		     of gates prior to the VM-USB completing intialization...
		     depending on when it actually asserts busy.  Once more SpecTcl
		     will only histogram the first of these events from the ADC.
		     As subsequent data from the ADC should be synchronized to the
		     IN1 trigger, this should at most affect the first event.

		     When setting up the SpecTcl parameters for this module,
		     remember that the module provides 9 parameters. The first
		     of these is a 48 bit timestamp.  The remaining 8 are the
		     adc parameters.  SpecTcl is not able to guess how you want to
		     set up the timestamp spectrum.  In general this is not a problem
		     as usuall you will be using the timestamp to generate rate
		     stripchart spectra rather than looking at the timestamp
		     itself.
		     </para>
	       </listitem>
	       <listitem>
		  <para>
		     When looking at SpecTcl timestamp based spectra you may see
		     significant gaps in the time online. This happens because of
		     the way data are sampled to SpecTcl from the online system.
		     SpecTcl may miss complete buffers of data online if it is not
		     able to keep up with the data rate.  If you process the
		     event file for that run offline, these gaps disappear.

           <para>
              The <command>madc</command> command provides scripted support
               for the Mesytec 32 channel peak sensing adc module.  For scaler
               support for this module's dead time counters, see the
               <link linkend="vmusb3-madcscaler">madcscaler</link> command.
           </para>
           <para>
               As with all VM-USB module support commands, <command>madc</command>
               is a command ensemble with subcommands that
               <command>create</command> and
               <command>config</command>ure modules as well as
               <command>cget</command> which introspects a module configuration.
           </para>
           <para>
               <command>create</command> creates an object with the specified
               <parameter>name</parameter>. Additional options are treated like
               configuration options.  <command>config</command> configures
               an existing module, and <command>cget</command> returns a list of
               configuration name/value pairs that describe the configuration of
               the module.
           </para>
            <para>
               It is important to note that the module configuration does not
               actually get loaded until the run is initialized.  The order in
               which configuration parameter are supplied is therefore unimportant.
               Think of the configuration options as being accumulated and then
               applied as the run starts.  Only modules that are in
               <command>stack</command> are configured.

                        this feature can reduce the external electronics needed to

                        2 of the scale down, that is
                        the final scale down is 1 &lt;&lt; <parameter>log2</parameter>.
                        By the time we get installed, I am supposed to have
                        some firwmare that will allow this to be a 16 bit
                        direct scaledown (e.g. the scaledown would be between 1 and
                        65535).

                        Channels which convert below their threshold are suppressed
                        from the data stream reducing both data volume and
                        dead-time.  The <parameter>valueList</parameter> is a

                        The firmware I bring with me at installation time
                        will hopefully implement this feature.

              readout completion).  Reading these two values as periodic scalers
              in a scaler stack, allows for the computation of dead-time ratios
              without the use of an additional external scaler module..

	   <para>
	      The <command>mase</command> command allows you to create and configure
	      modules that are XLM-VV FGPA modules with firmware for the
	      Indiana MASE data acqusitiopn subsystem.  Please note that this
	      modules is a block mode device, in the sense that each
	      VM-USB trigger may result in multiple events being present in the
	      XLM memory by the time the VM-USB reads the data.  When used with
	      other modules, you must arrange for event building at some point
	      in the system to ensure that data from the MASE module are coherently
	      assembled with data from other devices.
	   </para>
	   <para>
              The module object is created via the <command>create</command>
	      subcommand.  The <parameter>name</parameter> on this defines
	      a unique name which will be used to refer to this module in
	      future commands directed at it.  The optional options are
	      name value pairs used to configure the module.  See
	      OPTIONS below for a list of the supported options.
	   </para>
	   <para>
	      The <command>config</command> subcommand can be used to set or modify
	      configuration parameters after the module is created.  The
	      <parameter>name</parameter> is the name of the module as defined
	      by the <command>create</command> subcommand.   The options are
	      once more name value pairs that are described in the OPTIONS section
	      below.
	   </para>
	   <para>
	      The <command>cget</command> subcommand is can be used to ask
	      a module about its current configuration.  The module configuration is
	      returned as a Tcl list of name value pairs where the name is the
	      name of a configuration option described in the OPTIONS section
	      and the value is the value of that configuration parameter.

		       backplane with V430 extensions (V430 supplies additional
		       voltages and the slot location on a middle 'JAUX' connector).
		       The base address must be an unsigned integer.  There is no

     <para>
	Creates, configures and introspects CAEN V1x90 TDCs.  These modules
        are only supported in trigger matching mode.  Note that the trigger
        time is only good to the FPGA clock, to get precise trigger relative
        timing you will need to also digitize the trigger itself.  SpecTcl
        supports doing a digital subtraction of the trigger channel from
        all other channels to get precise trigger relative timing.

                Determines when the trigger matching window starts relative

                gate while a negative offset starts the match window prior to the
                gate.  The values are integers and are in 25ns units.  See
                section 2.4.1 for additional constraints.  Note that the actual
                window start time will jitter by +/-25ns, and therefore you should
                use a reference channel to get good gate relative timing.
                Values must be in the range -2048 to 40 inclusive...
                Defaults to -40 or 1usec prior to the gate.

                The extra search margin for hits.  This is the addtional
                time during after the matching window during which the module
                will search for hits that
                are within the window before declaring the event.  
                This is needed because hits are searched for in the
                module's L1 buffer. Contention may prevent matching hits
                from being written to the L1 buffer for some time after
                they have actually occured.  See 2.4.1 in the manual.
                The units of this value are also 25ns.

                 The reject margin.  This is also in 25ns units.  While
                 the module is in continuous storage, it maintains a reject
                counter that flushes hits from the buffer when the
                trigger window is not active.  The module will only
                retain hits for the width of the trigger 
                window + offset + reject marjin before throwing them away
                if there is no trigger.  This ensures the TDC buffer does
                not overflow and that the search for matching hits on the
                trigger is rapid.  
                Defaults to 4 which is 100ns.

           <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
           <para>
               The VM-USB supports eight readout <firstterm>stacks</firstterm>.
               A stack can be thought of as a set of VME operations the
               VM-USB should perform in response to some trigger condition.
               Reads performed by a stack are placed in an event buffer. Writes
               occure but result in no data.  At appropriate times, the VM-USB
               transmits buffers of read events to the host computer over its USB
               interface. Stacks provide avoid the high latency of the USB bus
               by pushing the readout intelligence for events into the VM-USB, and
               out of the host.
           </para>
           <para>
               The VM-USB supports 8 stacks, and  three kinds of triggers for stacks.
               While all stacks can be
               interrupt triggered, we simplify the VM-USB usage by only allowing
               stacks 2-7 to accept interrupt triggers, defining stack 0 to be
               only triggerable on the <literal>NIM1</literal> input, and stack
               1 to only be triggered with some time periodicity.
           </para>
            <para>
               The <command>stack</command> command allows you to compose stacks
               and specify their trigger conditions.  When data taking is
               enabled, all defined stacks are loaded into the VM-USB and
               their triggers set up.  Stacks are composed by specifying the
               set of modules they should read via the <option>-modules</option>
               configuration option.  All modules in a stack are initialized
               at stack load time and read when the stack is triggered, in the
               order in which they were specified.
            </para>
            <para>
               The <command>create</command> subcommand creates a stack named
               <parameter>name </parameter>.  <parameter>name</parameter>
               will be used by you in future <command>config</command> and
               <command>cget</command> subcommands to refer to this stack.
            </para>
            <para>
               The <command>config</command> subcommand allows you to configure
               the stack contents and trigger conditions of the stack.
               <parameter>name</parameter> determines which stack will be configured.
               The configuration is specified via a set of <replaceable>option value</replaceable>
               pairs.  These are described in OPTIONS below.
            </para>
            <para>
               The <command>cget</command> command returns the configuration of
               the stack as a well formed Tcl list of <replaceable>option value</replaceable>
               pairs.

      		<para>
                  Defines the strigger source for the stack.  When the designated
                  trigger is present, the stack will execute.
                  <literal>nim1</literal> triggers the stack on a nim logic true pulse
                  to the IN1 input of the VM-USB.  This forces the stack to be 
                  VM-USB stack number zero as that is the only stack that can be
                  triggered by the IN1.
      		</para>
                <para>
                  <literal>scaler</literal>
                  triggers the stack on the periodic scaler.  This forces the stack
                  to be stack number 1 as that is the only peridically triggerable stack.
                  We restrict periodic triggers to time based periodicity rather than
                  event division periodicity.  The <option>-period</option> option
                  defined below must be configured as well to define the periodicity
                  of the scaler stack.

                <para>
                  <literal>interrupt</literal>
                  indicates the stack will be interrupt triggered. This can be
                  used for stacks 2 through 7 as defined by the <option>-stack</option>
                  configuration parameter.   The actual VME interrupt that will trigger
                  the stack is defined by both its interrupt priority level
                  <option>-ipl</option> and the status id the interrupt source
                  places on the backplane in response to the interrupt acknowledge
                  cycle, and specified with the <option>-vector</option> configuration
                  parameter.

                  condition for these stacks. The <parameter>status-id</parameter>
                  must be a value between 0 and 255.

                  Defines the interrupt priority level that of the interrupt
                  that will trigger the stack.  An iterrupter places a 3 bit
                  interrupt priority level (IPL) on the VME bus when it requests
                  an interrupt.  The IPL must be nonzero and is intended to reflect
                  the priority of the interrupt (7 highest, 1 lowest), although, in fact,
                  the VME standard allows interrupt responders to treat this value
                  in any way they want.
               </para>
               <para>
                  The VM-USB uses the specified <parameter>priority</parameter> as
                  part of the trigger condition for an <literal>interrupt</literal>
                  <option>-trigger</option>-ed stack.  When an acknowledged interrupt
                  matches both the <option>-ipl</option>, and the <option>-vector</option>
                  configuration parameters of a stack the stack is triggered.

               <para>
                  The VM-USB allows you to define a delay between the stack trigger condition
                  and the actual start of stack execution.  This is normally intended to be used
                  with stacks that are triggered on <literal>nim1</literal>, as there may be
                  a significant time between the generation of an external trigger and the
                  conversion of the digitizers associated with the trigger.  As I read the
                  VM-USB manual, however this delay applies to <emphasis>all</emphasis> stacks.
               </para>
               <para>
                  The <parameter>microseconds</parameter> is the number of microseconds to delay
                  (0-255) between triggers and stack executions.  Because of my understanding of the
                  <emphasis>intent</emphasis> of this delay, the <option>-delay</option> option
                  is ignored for all stacks that are not <literal>nim1</literal>
                  <option>-trigger</option>-ed.
               </para>
               <para>
                  In the very unlikely event that you need to apply a trigger delay
                  to interrupt triggered stacks (most hardware interrupts when data
                  are ready not on a trigger), and you are not using <literal>nim1</literal>
                  triggered stacks, simply build a non-empty <literal>nim1</literal> triggered
                  stack, set it's
                  <option>-delay</option> option to the required delay and never trigger
                  that stack (don't cable anything to the IN1 input).

                  so far.  The modules are specified in the order in which readout
                  commands for them will be added to the stack.  If you have

               The example below is a rather complete demonstration of how to
               define a set of modules, adc's and scalers, aggregate the
               three adc's into a caenchain, and read that chain as a stack
               triggered on NIM1, and read a pair of scalers triggered every two seconds.

                        in section 3.4.3 of the VM-USB manual, determines how
                        scaler buffers are read and the delay between a readout

                            The VM-USB allows stacks to be triggered as a result
                            of VME interrupts.  4 interrupt registers are provided
                            as described in section 3.4.8.  Each register
                            describes the IPL and Status ID of two interrupts
                            and associates each of those with a stack.
                            This method allows you to program the value of one
                            of those registers.

                            generating a USB Packet end frame and the timeout

                            Performs a block read from the VME bus.  VME block
                            reads the requestor to only send an initial VME
                            base address followed by a new address every time
                            the address crosses a 256 byte boundary.  Subsequent
                            addresses are assumed  to represent a contiguous
                            block of storage.  Not all devices support block
                            transfers.  Block transfers also require specific
                            block transfer address modifiers.  When used properly,
                            block transfers allow higher throughput by
                            reducing the number of address cycles.

                            is a buffer that will receive the data read.
                            <parameter>transferCount</parameter> is the number
                            of longwords (32 bit items) to transfer.  All transfers
                            will be 32 bit wide transfers.  <parameter>countTransferred</parameter>
                            will be the actual number of longwords transferred.

                            For some devices it is possible to transfer fewer
                            items thatn the number of items requested.  An example
                            of this is the use of CAEN V785's in chained block
                            mode.  In that case, the read will transfer data
                            until the ADC's have no more data left at which time
                            the modules will return a bus error on the next transfer
                            and the VM-USB will insert a <literal>0xffffffff</literal>
                            marker in the data stream when the bus error occured.

                            The VM-USB supports variable sized block reads.
                            These operate by first performing a
                            read of the block count from some register and providing
                            a mask that indicates what part of that data
                            contains the transfer count.
                            The block count read must at some point be
                            folowed by a call to
                            <methodname>vmeVariableBlockRead</methodname>
                            to actually perform the block read.

                            count field.  The addressed module must support
                            byte addressing at this location.  <parameter>mask</parameter>
                            is the mask that defines the bit field containing
                            the count.
                            <parameter>amod</parameter> is the address modifier
                            for the transfer of the transfer count.

          <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
          <para>
            This object is used to build up lists (stacks) of VME commands.
            The normal procedure is to create an instance of a
            <classname>CVMUSBReadoutList</classname> and invoke its member
            functions to build up the list of operations desired.  The resulting
            list is then passed either to
            <classname>CVMUSB</classname>::<methodname>executeList</methodname>,
            which executes the operations in the list immediately and returns
            any data read.  Alternatively, if the list is being created for
            use as a data acquisition mode stack, it is passed to
            <classname>CVMUSB</classname>::<methodname>loadList</methodname>
            to load it into the VM-USB stack memory.

          </para>
          <para>
            <type>uint8_t</type> <parameter>amod</parameter> is always a VME Bus
            address modifier.  See CONSTANTS below for a list of the address

                    This is the constructor you will normally use.  It produces
                    an empty VM-USB stack which can be built up using
                    the remaining methods described in this section.

                    The VM-USB provides a set of instructions that
                    allow you to perform variable length block transfers.
                    This is done in two steps.   The first step readss the
                    length of the transfer from somewhere on the VME bus
                    (usually this is a module register).  The second step is
                    to actually perform the variable block transfer.

                    an 8 bit data transfer from the VME
                    bus and place the result in the output buffer or event.
                    The set of bits in that data defined by <parameter>mask</parameter>
                    are used to set the transfer count for the next variable length

                        go over a contiguous address block.  The bus master only
                        needs to perform an address cycle at the beginning of the
                        transfer and again as the address crosses 256 byte
                        boundaries.

                        Extended means addresses use the full 32 bits of width.

          <para>
            Provides remote access to the VM-USB via the VMUSBReadout's
            slow controls server.  This class is a proxy and transparently
            performs network operations with the slow control server to
            execute each method.

             <para>
                Each VM-USB device driver object contains an instance of
                a <classname>CConfigurableObject</classname>.  The driver
                defines its configuration parameters within that object and
                the object is transparently hooked into the driver command's
                config and cget methods so that the driver code does not have
                to worry about handling those commands.
             </para>
             <para>
                <classname>CConfigurableObject</classname> provides mechanisms
                for not only defining and retrieving configuration parameters, but
                for enforcing constraints on those parameters.  Constraint checking
                can include not only checking the type of a parameter but
                checking for completely arbitrary constraints on the values
                of the confgiguration parameter.
             </para>
             <para>
                Constraint checking is accomplished by associating a validity
                checking function with each parameter.  A set of pre-defined
                validity checking functions, implemented as static class methods
                mean that for most cases you don't need to define your own
                constraint checkers.
             </para>
             <para>
                Another side enforcing strong parameter typing and constraints is
                a set of parameter getters that transparently convert the
                string representation of a parameter to a form that is meaningful
                to the driver.
            </para>
            <para>
                As a simple example, consider a threshold value that must be
                an integer in the range of <literal>[0..4095]</literal>.
                This can be easily defined as a configuration parameter that
                uses the predefined <methodname>isInteger</methodname>
                constraint checker passed an appropriate limit checking
                structure.  When retrieving the paramter, since the <command>config</command>
                subcommand has already perfromed type and range checking, the
                driver can simply use <methodname>getIntegerParameter</methodname>
                to retrieve the parameter value without worrying about
                having any illegal values for the parameter.

            <para>
                A type checker is a function that can be passed to
                <methodname>addParameter</methodname> to check constraints on
                the value of a parameter. See below in BUILT IN TYPE CHECKERS
                for information about the constraint checkers that are
                available for drop in use.

            <para>
                A type checker <function>myTypeChecker</function>
                function has the following signature:

                <parameter>name</parameter> is the name of the configuration
                parameter that is being checked.

            <para>
                <parameter>value</parameter> is the proposed new string value

            </para>
            <para>
                <parameter>arg</parameter> is the
                <parameter>arg</parameter> parameter in the
                <methodname>addParameter</methodname> method.  While not always
                the case, this parameter usually is a pointer to some struct
                or object that further refines the constraint checking required.
                For example, for the <methodname>isInteger</methodname> pre-packaged
                checker, this parameter is a pointer to a struct that defines
                whichi limits should be checked and what those limit values
                are, where appropriate.

                Type checkers are supposed to return <literal>true</literal>

                        This type checker requires that the proposed new
                        <parameter>value</parameter> is a valid Tcl list.
                        The <parameter>arg</parameter> parameter points to a
                        <type>isListParameter</type>.  This is described in
                        TYPES below.  The struct allows you to constrain the list
                        size as well as to provide an additional type checker
                        that is applied to each element of the list.

	   <title>DESCRIPTION</title> 
	   <para>
	     <classname>CControlHardware</classname> is an abstract base class for
	     slow control drivers.  To build a driver one must build a concrete
	     derived class, a <classname>CModuleCreator</classname> and register 
	     them with the <classname>CModuleFactory</classname> which associates
	     a module type string with a creator.
	   </para>
	   <para>
	     The base class and its <classname>CControLModule</classname> take care
	     of configuration management, command dispatching and parameter marshalling
	     for the methods of this class.  This framework therefore frees people
	     writing controls support software from most tasks not directly related to
	     controlling their devices.
	   </para>
	   <para>
	     The driver framework supports get and set operations and these transparently 
	     interrupt data taking if active.  Thus a series of sets or gets performed
	     while data taking is active can take a substantial time as each get or set
	     will pause data taking, flush in-flight buffers, perform the operatin and then
	     resume data taking.
	   </para>
	   <para>
	     In addition to get and set operations, the driver supports using a periodically
	     triggered list to monitor device state.  This monitoring does
	     <emphasis>not</emphasis> impact data taking other than the time required to
	     execute the list.   This mechanism is normally used to support the recognition
	     of exceptional states in the hardware (e.g. trips in detector bias supplies).
	   </para>
	   <para>
	     Implementation of the set/get interface is mandatory (those methods are pure
	     virtual)  Implementation of the monitor list operations is optional, as there
	     are do-nothing default behaviors defined in this base class.

                            The base class constructor makes a correspondence between
                            the name of the module and the actual device.  Therefore
                            when you construct an object you should invoke this
                            base class constructor passing <parameter>name</parameter>

		    This method must be implemented by concrete sub-classes.
		    It is intended for use by drivers that work with devices that have 
		    write only state.  The method is called by clients that want to
		    push shadow data out to the write only state of the device.  Typically,
		    a device of this sort would have an initialization file that
		    describes the desired initial state of the device.  The <methodname>Update</methodname>
		    often is a means to push that state out to the device when the GUI starts and
		    reads in the same initializationfile.

                    The commands in this section are used to determine the
                    set of VM-USB controllers attached to the host and
                    identify them by serial number.

                        Enumerates the set of VM-USB devices that are
                        attached to and powered up on the host.  The result
                        of this command is <type>usb_device_vector</type>.
                        You can think of this as a sort of an array with integer
                        indices whose elements represent a single VM-USB device.
                        See below for commands that can manipulate this vector.

            <para>
                This set of commands is used to construct CVMUSB objects.
                The return value of these constructors is a command. The
                command can be either explicitly named by the
                <parameter>name</parameter> parameter in each of these
                constructors or you can use the name <literal>%AUTO</literal>
                to allow constructors to generate a unique object command
                name.

            <para>
                Creates a new CVMUSBusb object given a <parameter>usbdevice</parameter>
                gotten from
                <command>::cvmusb::usb_device_vector_get</command>.
                This results in a new command <parameter>name</parameter> unless
                <parameter>name</parameter> is the special value
                <literal>%AUTO</literal>, in which case a unique name will be
                assigned the object. To construct a CVMUSB-type object to control
                a locally connected usb, this CVMUSBusb constructor must be used rather than 
                a CVMUSB because the C++ CVMUSB base class is abstract and cannot be instantiated.
                SWIG therefore does not produce a cvmusb::CVMUSB constructor. With that said, 
                the object produced by this command will inherit the functionality of the
                cvmusb::CVMUSB type.

                Naturally if you use <literal>%AUTO</literal> as the name

                of the VM-USB.  It is beyond the scope of this document to fully
                describe these registers.  For each method, therefore, a high level
                description will be given along with the VM-USB reference manual
                section that does fully describe the register.

            This register is described in section 3.4.3 of the VM-USB manual.
            It contains bit fields that control the way in which the scaler stack
            is trigggered and the delay between a trigger and stack start.
            Note that within the VM-USB readout framework, this register is
            programmed by the framework at the start of each run.  You will
            only need to program this register if you are building pure Tcl
            applications with the VM-USB.

                The VM-USB has two internal Gate and delay generators named
                A and B.  Section 3.4.6 describes the registers that control
                these resources. The
                bit fields in this register control the gate width and delay of
                the A gate and delay generator.

                The vector registers are described in section 3.4.8 of the VM-USB
                Manual.  The VM-USB supports triggering stacks as a result of
                an interrupt on the VME bus.  To do this, an interrupt service vector
                register must be programmed with the IPL, the vector and stack id.
                The interrupt sevice vectors are in pairs numbered <literal>1-4</literal>.
                This function returns one of those pairs.

                The VM-USB provides the ability to do a variable sized block read.
                When using this facility you first perform a VME read operation
                to obtain the number of transfers in the block read.
                You then perform the block read itself
                </para>
            <para>
                The block read count is a field in the data transferred from
                the VME <parameter>address</parameter>/<parameter>amod</parameter>
                specified by a <parameter>mask</parameter>.  This method performs
                an 16 bit read from the VME bus and uses the
                <parameter>mask</parameter> provided to determine which bits
                constitute the transfer size.  The resulting block transfer
                size is saved for the variable block transfer operation which
                should immediately follow.

                 <para>
                    This package encapsulates a <classname>CVMUSBReadoutList</classname>
                    class/object.  The class allows you to create instances
                    of VME operation lists.  Once created, you can add
                    operations to that list that can either be executed
                    immediately or stored fro execution in data taking mode
                    in response to an appropriate trigger.
                 </para>
                 <para>
                    For more information about this class and its methods,
                    see METHODS below.  The class also defines a set of
                    variables that contain the VME address modifier values.
                    See VARIABLES for information about those.

                        Two construction mechanisms are provided.  The first
                        creates an empty list.  The second creates an object
                        that wraps itself around a pointer to an existing list.

                <para>
                    Constructed objects appear like a command ensemble who's
                    base command name is the <parameter>name</parameter> parameter
                    to the constructor command.  If the special name
                    <literal>%AUTO</literal> is specified, the constructor will
                    assign a unique name.  In all cases the base name of the
                    command ensemble (or object name) is returned by the constructor.

                    This group of methods add single shot VME operations
                    and register transfers to a list.  A VME operation is
                    specified by both an address and an address modifier.
                    The address modifier selects a specific address space.

                <para>
                    The VM-USB is capable of several types of block transfer
                    operations.  If the address modifier is a block transfer
                    address modifier, the VM-USB will take advantage of that
                    mode of transfer.
                </para>
            </formalpara>
                <para>
                    VME block transfer operations allow a significant
                    improvment in performance by reducing the number of address
                    cycles asserted on the bus by the master.  Specifically,
                    in steady state operation, an address is only cycled on the
                    bus as the transfer address crosses a 256 byte address
                    boundary.  In between these boundaries, slave boards that
                    support block transfers are assumed to maintain counters
                    that keep track of the transfer offset within the 256 byte
                    page.
                </para>
                <para>
                    In addition to block transfer operations as described above,
                    the VM-USB also supports FIFO block transfers.   A FIFO
                    block transfer is just a block transfer that always asserts
                    the base address when an address cycle is required.

                    size depends on a bit field in a value read from the VME
                    bus.

                    is placed in the output/event buffer and the transfer terminates.
                    Note that if the last transfer was a bus error and the data
                    in a successful transfer might have been a <literal>0xffffffff</literal>,
                    there is some ambiguity about how the transfer actually terminated.
                    If you expect that the tranfer might be terminated by a bus
                    error "normally", ber sure to specify a transfer count very
                    much in exceess of what you might reasonably expect to get.

            This command is processed by the Tcl slow controls server when it
            processes the control configuration file.  It is used to create,
            configure and query the configuration of slow controls
            modules.

                    This slow control module supports remote execution of
                    arbitrary VM-USB lists.  Full documentation of this facility
                    will be produced in a later version of this document.
                    The idea is, however that the module, which has no
                    configuration options, has exactly one parameter,
                    <literal>list</literal>

                    <literal>list</literal> is a set only parameter.  It's
                    value is a Tcl list.  The first element of thel ist specifies
                    the maximum input buffer size required by the list.
                    The second value of the list is a Tcl list containing
                    the VM-USB stack.  The Set operation executes the stack
                    and returns the text <literal>Ok - </literal> followed by a
                    Tcl list  whose elements are the bytes of data put in the
                    read buffer by the stack.

    <para>
When the user intends to read out CAMAC devices through the VM-USB this driver can be used if the branch driver is a CES CBD8210. This class maintains a camac branch driver object that must encapsulate the necessary functionality for controlling the CAMAC devices on its branch. The camac branch driver essentially provides the means for translating standard bcnaf commands to VME commands that are executable by the VM-USB in a command stack. It must also properly implements the CCamacBranchDriver interface. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
A CAMAC branch is just a bunch of CAMAC crates strung together with a common branch number. For this reason, the CBDCamacBranch must be told which branch number it is operating on and also the camac crates that exist on the branch. Be sure that the camac crates registered to the branch are consistent with the driver being used by the CBDCamacBranch. In other words, modules prefixed by CBD, like CBDCamacCrates, must be registered to the CBDCamacBranch if the driver has been defined as a CES CBD8210.

     <para>
The CBDCamacCrate command defines a container type driver that holds a registry of modules. It is designed to work on a CAMAC branch rooted in a VME crate by a CES CBD8210 device. If this is not the case, use of this driver will fail. In addition, the modules that are registered to this crate must also be capable of working with a CBD8210 device. This module cannot operate on its own and must be registered to a valid CBDCamacBranch.

At the start of every run, the initialization procedures will be called for all of the registered modules in the order the modules were listed.

The CBDLeCroy4300B cannot be registered as a stack module by itself. Instead it must be registered first to a CBDCamacCrate. That CBDCamacCrate must then be registered to a CBDCamacBranch module. See the example below to understand how this works.

  <para>
There are a number of options that are provided to ultimately control the command register of the device. The command register is what establishes how the FERA will read out its data. Two options must be specified to operate the device, -pedestals and slot. If either of these are not specified, the initialization of the module will fail.

     <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
The CBDLeCroy4434 is intended to control a LeCroy 4434 scaler situated on a camac branch rooted in a VME crate by a CES CBD8210 branch driver. If you intend to utilize the driver in a camac crate controlled by a CCUSB, see the LeCroy4434 command. It provides the exact same functionality but understands the CCUSB to be its controller.
  </para>

  <para>
The CBDLeCroy4434 cannot be registered as a stack module by itself. Instead it must be registered first to a CBDCamacCrate. That CBDCamacCrate must then be registered to a CBDCamacBranch module. See the example below to understand how this works.
  </para>

  <para>
  During initialization, all scalers are cleared and the auxiliary bus is disabled. 
  </para>

  <para>
  At the end of the run, no actions are taken. 
  </para>

  <para>
  During stack execution initiated by an event trigger, this driver will operate based on the following logic:
  <programlisting>

  Read all channels
  if "-incremental" is true
      Clear the module
  </programlisting>

  Just as a note, the latch and the clear are not atomic.

  </para>

  <para>
  During stack execution initiated by an event trigger, all 12 scaler channels are read individually. There is no clear at the end of an event.
  </para>

  <para>
  It is important for the user to understand that format of the data is outputted by the VMUSB when this scaler is used. Each channel readout consists of two separate 16-bit reads that accomplish the reading of the upper bits followed by the lower 16-bits of the actual scaler value. This is done because the CBD8210 is a D16 device rather than a D32 device. There is no getting around it. What this means is that the actual scaler values need to be filtered or processed before they look like meaningful numbers.

        By default, the ULM will only load the firmware if it fails to validate the configuration. This occurs always after a bad firmware load or after a crate has been power cycled. Firmware loads take a bit of time so it is worthwhile to skip reloading the firmware on every run. However, sometimes it may be considered useful. This option causes the firmware to be loaded at the start of EVERY run. Defaults to false.

     <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

     <para>
      The XLMTimestamp module is a driver to control an JTech XLM running a 64-bit latching scaler firmware. It is intended to be used specifically with the stamp64.bit firmware written by Daniel Bazin at the NSCL.
    </para>

  <para>
  During initialization, the firmware is loaded and all scalers are cleared. 
  </para>

  <para>
  At the end of the run, no actions are taken. 
  </para>

  <para>
  During stack execution initiated by an event trigger, the 64-bits of scaler are read out in two 32-bit chunks. The lower 32-bits are read first and the upper 32-bits are read second.

     <para>
      The XLMFERA module is a driver to control a JTech XLM72V running firmware to handle readout of FERA modules via ECL ports. The XLM actually interfaces with a LeCroy 4301 FERA driver to accomplish this. The firmware associated with this is the xferajan.bit firmware that was written primarily by an unknown author but was assisted by Jan Toke (JTech). 
    </para>

    <para>
     This is just a derived class of the CXLM base class. 
    </para>

  <para>
  During initialization, the firmware is loaded. The user must provide the path to the firmware file by means of the -firmware option. If no firmware file is specified or the path provided is invalid, an exception will be thrown. The firmware will always be validated on initialization by a validation test. This validation test reads the signature of the firmware from the device and compares it to the value passed by the -configuration option. If these numbers are not identical or the -forceFirmwareLoad flag is set to true, the firmware will be loaded. The user will be alerted to the success of the validation via messages printed to the console. Immediately following the firmware load, the validation test is repeated and the user will be alerted of the results. An exception will be thrown if the validation test fails at this point.
  </para>

  <para>
  At the end of the run, no actions are taken. 
  </para>

  <para>
  During stack execution, a block transfer is executed. First, the lowest 16-bits of memory in the sramA is read via a 32-bit read. The value of these 16-bits will be used to specify the number of 32-bit transfers to execute in a subsequent block transfer. The block transfer will begin at 5th byte of sramA (i.e. the second 32-bits).

  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

     <para>
    The AXLM72ScalerControl driver is a pure-TCL driver that is used to communicate with the XLM72 when running the ech32x24.bit firmware. It implements the CControlHardware interface as is equivalent in TCL. When loaded into the slow-controls server, any remote process can send it commands that it will translate into actual communication with a specific XLM72 device. It communicates through the low-level driver for the ech32x24.bit firmware called AXLM72Scaler. The XLM72ScalerGUI requires that an instance of this class is registered as a TCL module (see Module command), in the slow-controls server.

          The Set command causes a write to the XLM72. There are 34 supported parameters: enable, reset, trigger0, trigger1, trigger2, ..., and trigger31. The number appended to the trigger parameter identifies the channel number. The values provided for reset and the any trigger must be either 0 or 1, and the value of the reset command is ignored. The returned value is the status value of the return value for the write operation (0 => success, otherwise => failure).

          The Get command causes a read from the XLM72. There are 5 parameters that can be provided to this method: enable, alltriggers, firmware, runstate, and allscalers. These all return the value read from the device. The enable parameter returns a 0 or 1 indicating whether the scalers are enabled. The alltriggers parameter returns a 32-bit integer with the status of each channel's trigger status encoded in its bits. Channel 0's status is encoded in bit 0 and channel 31's status is encoded in bit 31, with all others likewise. The firmware parameter returns the firmware signature. The runstate parameter causes a return of the run state as one of the following strings: idle, starting, stopping, active, paused. Finally the allscalers parameters causes the scaler values to be latched and read out of the device. These are returned as a list of 32 integers beginning with channel 0.

  <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
  <para>
The XLM72ScalerGUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides interactive control over an XLM72 running the ech32x24.bit firmware in a crate being readout by VMUSBReadout program. This firmware was written and is supported by Daniel Bazin and the software driver that supports the readout is provided by NSCLDAQ as the AXLM72Scaler tcl driver. The XLM72ScalerGUI is a UI that displays the scaler values of the XLM72 when not in DAQ mode and gives the user some basic control over the XLM72 while the VMUSB is not in acquisition mode. It is primarily a diagnostics tools that can be used to enable or disable the scaler channels from counting, to clear the scaler counters, and also to repeatedly update the values at a selectable frequency.

    <title>Configuration</title>

    <para>
      The XLM72ScalerGUI is designed as a client-server architecture and thus using it requires setting up two different pieces: the client and the server. The setup of the server will be explained first. To avoid confusion, the server that will be communicated with is the VMUSBReadout slow-controls server and thus setting it up requires loading a driver with the needed functionality into it. The specific driver to be used is contained in the AXLM72ScalerControl class. It is just a standard slow-controls driver written purely in TCL that implements the Set, Get, and Update methods. Once an instance has been created of the AXLM72ScalerControl class, it needs to be registered as a TCL module using the ?Module? command. The name of the ensemble is just the name of the instance created. As with all slow-controls set up, this must be done in the ctlconfig.tcl file. The name of the AXLM72ScalerControl instance is not important so long as it does not conflict with any other tcl commands (e.g. setting the name to ?set? would lead to unexpected failures). Here is a sample of how to set it up in the ctlconfig.tcl file.
    </para>

    <example>
    <title>Example ctlconfig.tcl entry</title>
    <programlisting>
package require scalerxlm72			          ;# load the plugin

AXLM72ScalerControl XLM72SclrCtl -slot 5  ;# Create an instance of for an XLM72 in slot 5

Module create tcl xlm72sclrctl		        ;# Create a new pure tcl module named xlm72sclrctl
Module config xlm72sclrctl -ensemble XLM72SclrCtl ;# set the name of the ensemble to be the same as the name of the instance
    </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
The second portion of the XLM72ScalerGUI is the setup of the client. The client is much simpler and amounts to running the XLM72ScalerGUI program with the appropriate arguments. This program requires a few pieces of information to successfully communicate with the server. Those are the name of the host running the VMUSBReadout slow-controls server, the port on which that server is listening for connections, the name of the ringbuffer being filled by the VMUSBReadout program, and the name of the slow-controls module that is receiving requests from the GUI. In the above example, the name of that module would be "xlm72sclrctl".  
    </para>

    <para>
    That is it. If you want know why the ringbuffer name is needed read on about run state awareness.

    <title>Run State Awareness</title>
    <para>
  The XLM72ScalerGUI is only allowed to query the XLM72 while a run is not in progress. When a run is in progress (i.e. the VM-USB is in data acquisition mode rather than interactive mode), all of the GUI components become disabled except for the Exit button. When a run ends, the GUI components become active again. The idea is that the XLM72ScalerGUI is really a diagnostics tool rather than a tool for data acquisition. In order to respond to run state transitions, the GUI needs to have some run state awareness. Two mechanisms provide this to form some redundancy. The primary means by which it obtains run state information is through a sclclient program attached to the ringbuffer filled by the VMUSBReadout program. This is why the user must provide the name of the ringbuffer, when starting up the GUI. The sclclient communicates with a TclServer embedded into the GUI and manages a variable called RunState. Unfortunately, this approach is leaves a small chance that the GUI sends a request after the run has started but before the sclclient has alerted the TclServer of the change. In this scenario, the second redundancy kicks in because the first thing that happens before a request is a request from the slow-controls server to return the run state. If the run state is not idle, then it is assumed that a run is in progress. Otherwise, the requests proceed as usual. 
    </para>

    <para>
      This may seem overkill but there is a good reason for doing it this way that is tied to how the slow-controls server handles requests while in acquisition mode. Should a request come in that mode, the VMUSB will exit acquisition mode, process the request, and then resume acquisition. Unfortunately, ending a run usually lasts about a second or two, which causes long wait times. To avoid repeated interruptions like this, the above scheme ensures that at most, one interruption can occur. Understand that no data is ever lost in these scenarios, the data stream is simply interrupted for a period of time.

           <para>
 This is the IncrTcl base class for the family of XLM72 devices. It provides
 a large number of convenience functions that derived classes can use
 in their drivers. The JTech XLM72 family of devices are general purpose
 logic modules that have no real function independent of the firmware
 loaded onto them. For this reason, derived classed typically handle
 how to interact with devices that are running a specific firmware.

           <para>
 This device is mostly just a 32-bit latching scaler but has the feature
 that channel inputs can be redirected as a trigger output. The trigger 
 output is the result of OR'ing all of the input signals of channels
 whose trigger bits are set. 
          </para>

          <para>
 The scaler can be enabled/disabled and atomically cleared (aka reset).

         <para>
          The slow controls protocol allows control panel software
          to be built that communicates with slow controls drivers
          in the VM-USB raadout framework.   This is intended to allow
          the contruction of control panels for devices that have slow
          controls drivers.  Note that the <classname>vmusb</classname>
          controller allows drivers to be written for devices
          that don't have slow controls drivers yet.
         </para>
         <para>
          The slow controls server listens for connections on the port
          specified by the Readout program's <option>--port</option>
          option or <literal>27000</literal> if that option is not
          specified.
         </para>
         <para>
          Connected clients send commands to the server as lines
          of text and get back singe line replies.  Replies are
          expected to begin with <literal>OK</literal> if the request
          was successful and <literal>ERROR</literal> otherwise.
          The text that follows the header text depends on the
          driver.

                          is a parameter that must be recognized by
                          the driver that manage that module.
                          <parameter>value</parameter> must be a valid
                          new value for that parameter.

                          <parameter>module-name</parameter> is the name

                          <parameter>module-parameter</parameter>
                          is a parameter that must be recognized by
                          the driver that manage that module.
                          It is entirely up to the module driver to
                          decide what is returned, however by
                          convention, as described above, the string
                          returned will begin either with
                          <literal>OK</literal> or
                          <literal>ERROR</literal>.
