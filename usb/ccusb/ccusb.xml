    <para>
        The CCUSB Readout framework provides support for the Wiener-JTec
        CC-USB CAMAC controller.  The CC-USB is a USB CAMAC controller that
        uses a Xilinx gate array to implement a CAMAC list processor.
        The CCUSB Readout framework provides:

        <title>How the CCUSB readout framework works</title>
        <para>
            The CCUSB readout framework provides a high level approach to
            configuring devices supported by the system.  A plugin architecture
            allows user written device support to be incorporated into
            the framework at run-time.  
        </para>
        <para>
            The framework supports both data taking devices and slow control
            devices that may require a control panel.  Naturally you can
            support relatively static slow control devices by using the
            data taking device support as well.
        </para>
        <para>
            The recurring concepts for both the data taking device support
            and slow controls device support are:

                    Each supported device class is represented in the
                    configuration file by a Tcl command ensemble. The
                    command ensemble provides subcommands that allow you to
                    create, configure and query the configuration of
                    physical devices (device instances).

                    The device configuration is represented in the configuration
                    file in manner analagous to the state of a Tk widget.
                    That is, you never actually program the device directly,
                    you simply specify the desired configuration. The actual
                    programming is done by the device class's device support
                    software.

                    In accordance with the way the CC-USB operates, you can create
                    two lists or <firstterm>stack</firstterm>s in CC-USB parlance.
                    One stack is an event stack and is intended to be used
                    to handle event triggers.  The second stack is a scaler stack
                    and typically is set to readout periodically.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Each stack has, configuration properties as well. One
                    configuration property is the set of modules managed
                    by that stack.  Modules managed by that stack are initialized
                    by the software, in accordance with their configuration,
                    and contribute to the readout list that executes in response
                    to that stack's trigger.

        <title>Writing DAQ configuration files</title>
        <para>
            The DAQ configuration file is processed at the beginning of each run.
            The configuration file is processed in a fresh interpreter each time.
            You therefore cannot maintain any state across runs via your configuration
            file.
        </para>
        <para>
            To illustrate module creation and configuration,
            this let's look at a fragment from a configuration
            file:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Creating and configuring devices</title>
            <programlisting>
ph7xxx create tdc -slot 13 -id 0x7186 -sparse false
ph7xxx config tdc -readhits true -usellt false -usehlt false
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The ph7xxx driver supports the Phillips 7xxx series
            CAMAC 16 channel digitizers.  The <command>ph7xxx</command> command is the Tcl
            command this driver recognizes.  The <command>create</command>
            subcommand creates a new device instance and names it <literal>tdc</literal>.
            When you create a module any addition command words following the
            device name are interpreted as configuration options.
            In this case, the module is configured to be in slot 13,
            the driver is configured to emit a literal value (<option>-id</option>)
            <literal>0x7186</literal> prior to data from the device.
            The module is also configured to read all channels
            (<option>-sparse</option> <literal>false</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
            The <command>config</command> subcommand allows you to further
            configure the options of a device instance.  The second line
            of the example continues specifying the configuration of the
            device named <literal>tdc</literal>.  The configuration parameters
            on that line request the driver to read the hit pattern register
            (<option>-readhits</option> <literal>true</literal>), to not
            enable  either the lower level threshold or the upler level threshold
            (<option>-usellt</option> and <option>usehlt</option>).
        </para>
        <para>
            The reference section <literal>3ccusb</literal> provides detailed
            information that describes each supported device and the
            configuration options it supports.
        </para>
        <para>
            Configuration files must also specify at least one stack and, if
            scaler modules are to be read periodically, a second scaler stack.
            See the <xref linkend="ccusb3-stack" /> command
            in the reference material for detailed information about how
            to create and configure stacks.
        </para>
        <para>
            To continue with the previous example:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Configuring an event stack</title>
            <programlisting>
stack create events
stack config events -modules [list tdc] -type event -delay 108
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            Stacks are created and configured exactly like any other module.
            In this configuration file fragment, a stack named
            <literal>events</literal> is created.  It is configured to
            manage the <literal>tdc</literal> module (<option>-modules</option>).
            It is configured as the event stack (<option>-type</option>) which,
            by default is triggered by a nim pulse in the <literal>IN1</literal>
            input of the module. The <option>-delay </option> parameter
            specifies a delay of 108usec between the trigger input and stack
            execution.  This capability is provided to allow the digitizers
            in the stack time to convert.
        </para>
        <para>
            Finally here's a configuration file fragment that sets up an
            LRS 2551 scaler and the scaler stack:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Setting up a scaler stack</title>
            <programlisting>

lrs2551 create counters -slot 5
stack create scaler
stack config scaler -type scaler -period 2 -modules [list counters]

            </programlisting>
        </example>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Writing device support software</title>
        <para>
            This section describes how to write a device support module.
            Device support modules are built into shared object libraries
            that can be dynamically loaded into the readout software via
            the <command>load</command> command.
        </para>
        <para>
            The device support package is provided as a template driver
            source file and a Makefile that builds the shared object.
            If the DAQ software is installed in $DAQROOT, the following
            commands copy the template driver and its makefile:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Obtaining the ccusb driver development kit</title>
            <programlisting>
<command>cp $DAQROOT/ccusbdriver/drivertemplate.cpp .</command>
<command>cp $DAQROOT/ccusbdriver/Makefile .</command>
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The example below shows how to load a user written driver
            and use the driver that is created by an unmodified driver template:
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Using a user written CCUSB driver</title>
            <programlisting>
set here [file nativename [file dirname [info script]]]
load [file join $here libtemplatedriver.so]
changeme create testing -value 0x1234
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The example assumes that you have built the driver in the same
            directory as your configuration file.  The first example line
            computes the full file path to the configuration file's directory.
            The second loads the driver, joining that path to the name of the
            shared object created by the Makefile.  Note that you typically will
            need to provide a full path to the driver shared object or the
            <command>load</command> command will claim the file cannot be located.
            The final command creates and configures a device instance
            named <literal>testing</literal> using the <command>changeme</command>
            command the unmodified driver creates.
        </para>
        <para>
            Let's look at the template driver you copied.
            The template consists of two main chunks.  The first chunk is a
            class derived from <classname>CReadoutHardware</classname> that is
            responsible for managing the driver itself. You will normally
            need to modify the <methodname>onAttach</methodname>,
            <methodname>Initialize</methodname> and <methodname>addReadoutList</methodname>
            methods of this class, as well as changing the class name to something
            more reasonable than <classname>CTemplateDriver</classname>.
        </para>
        <para>
            The second chunk is a Tcl package initialization function that
            must define the Tcl command that is associated twith the driver.
        </para>
        <para>
            While the driver template is heavily commented, and modification
            points are indicated, the next few sections are a guided tour
            of the main sections you will need to modify.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>The driver onAttach method</title>
            <para>
                Each driver instance has a configuration database attached to it
                when it is created.  The configuration database holds configuration
                parameter definitions and their current values.  The framework
                takes care of managing the values for you, however you must
                define the set of configuration parameters supported by your
                driver.
            </para>
            <para>
                The template driver's code is (comments removed for brevity:

                        The <parameter>configuration</parameter> parameter is
                        a reference to that configuration.  This line
                        saves a pointer to that configuration in the

                range of <option>-slot</option> parameter values e.g.) which
                are checked by the configuration subsystem without any intervention
                by you.  Several pre-defined constraint checkers are available,
                as are convenience functions for defining configuration parameters.
                You can also define custom constraint checkers and register them
                with the configuration subsystem.

                after the configuration file is processed prior to loading

            as Tcl modules.  The first subsection will describe in general
            terms how to do this.  The second and third subsections will show
            sample drivers written in the snit and Incr-Tcl object oriented
            extensions of Tcl along with sample fragments of DAQ configuration
            files that show how to use these drivers. Note that while snit and
            Incr-Tcl drivers are shown any Tcl object oriented extension can
            probably be used as could a carefully crafted set of
            <command>namespace ensemble</command> commands.

                you should at least skim it.  Several of the concepts
                are important.  Specifically:
            </para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        A device support module provides a command that

                        Device instances have to provide an
                        <methodname>Initialize</methodname> method that
                        initializes the device according to some configuration
                        of the instance.

                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Device instances have to provide a
                        <methodname>addReadoutList</methodname> method that
                        adds elements to the list of CAMAC operations
                        that are executed when the stack they live in
                        is triggered.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <para>
                All of this is a natural match to the way all of the object
                oriented extensions to Tcl work.  Specifically you write a
                class like thing.  Creating an instance of the class creates
                a new Tcl command <firstterm>ensemble</firstterm>.  The
                public methods of the instance become sub commands of the
                new Tcl command.  
            </para>
            <para>
                The CCUSB framework therefore provides a
                mechanism, the <command>addtcldriver</command> command to
                add an object instance command to the set of devices that
                can be added to a stack. The <command>addtcldriver</command>
                command registers the command name as a name of a  device
                that can be put in a stack.  The command ensemble is also
                wrapped in an actual driver that invokes
                <methodname>Initialize</methodname>, and
                <methodname>addReadoutList</methodname>
                methods at the appropriate times.

            <para>
                The final piece of the puzzle is providing access to the
                CCUSB and CCUSBReadout list capabilities to Tcl drivers.
                This has been done by wrapping Tcl command ensembles around both
                of those classes using SWIG
                (see <ulink url='http://www.swig.org'>http://www.swig.org</ulink>).
            </para>
            <para>
                As we will see when we work our way through sample drivers,
                the C++ wrappers are not able to actually pass a SWIG wrapped
                object to the driver methods.  The driver must take the
                swig pointer like parameter and turn it into a SWIG object
                before it can be used.  A Tcl fragment that shows how to
                turn the CCCUSB pointer into a SWIG CCCUSB object is shown
                below:

            <para>
                The example takes the <varname>ccusbPointer</varname> parameter
                which must be a swig like pointer to  a CCCUSB object and
                turns it in to a swig object named <literal>c</literal>
                which is a SWIG object representing the underlying CCCUSB
                passed in to the <methodname>Initialize</methodname> method.

            <title>A sample snit Tcl CCUSB framework driver</title>
            <para>
                This section will go through a sample snit driver describing
                how it works.  To see this driver incorporated in a DAQ
                configuration file see
                <xref linkend='ccusb-general-tcldriver-usage' />.

            <para>
                First a word or two about snit.  Snit is a pure Tcl object
                oriented framework for Tcl written by Will Duquette from
                the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
                <ulink url='http://wiki.tcl.tk/3963'>
                    http://wiki.tcl.tk/3963</ulink>
                provides access to documentation and examples of snit in action.
            </para>
            <para>
                snit is part of the <literal>TclLib</literal> which is installed
                on all systems at the NSCL.
            </para>
            <para>
                Snit classes are created via the <command>snit::type</command>
                command.  Snit classes feature <command>method</command>s
                which are analagous to member functions in C++ classes.
            </para>
            <para>
                snit also
                provides all types with a <command>configure</command> and
                <command>cget</command> command and a mechanism for declaring
                options that can be manipulated by these commands. Using this
                capability allows you to configure snit device driver instances
                in a manner analagous to the C++ driver instances supported
                by the CCUSB framework.
            </para>
            <para>
                Below is a complete implementation of a snit driver that,
                at initialization time turns on the yellow LED and adds
                a marker to the readout list.  The marker value can be configured
                via the instances built in configure subcommand.

            <title>A sample Incr-Tcl Tcl CCUSB framework driver</title>
            <para>
                Incr Tcl is an object oriented extension for Tcl.  It is installed
                on all NSCL systems.  It provides the ability to define
                <firstterm>classes</firstterm>. As with snit, creating a class
                 instance (object) creates a new command.  The public class
                 methods are then subcommands for the object command.
            </para>
            <para>
                As with snit, objects can have configurations that are manipulated
                and queried via built in <command>config</command> and
                <command>cget</command> object subcommands.  Unlike snit,
                all public member variables are considered to be
                configurable objects to Incr Tcl.
            </para>
            <para>
                The properties above make Incr Tcl a viable option for
                implementing driver support.

                The example below shows a marker driver identical in functionality
                to the snit driver shown in the previous section, but written

                <para>
                    Tcl provides two suitable mechanisms for incorporating
                    device support code into your DAQ configuration script.  Note
                    that these mechanisms are not restricted to device support
                    code but could be used to incorporate any Tcl library code
                    you might need.
                </para>
            </formalpara>
            <para>
                The <command>source</command> command allows you to include
                a specific Tcl script file given a relative or absolute path
                directly to that script.  Suppose our device support
                file named <filename>mydriver.tcl</filename> is located
                in the same directory as the configuration script.  The
                code fragment below is an accepted way to source that file
                that doesn ot assume the current working directory is where the
                script is:
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <programlisting>
set here [file dirname [info script]]
source [file join $here mydriver.tcl]
                </programlisting>
            </informalexample>
            <para>
                The first command determines the directory that holds the
                script while the second uses that to construct a path to the
                <filename>mydriver.tcl</filename> file for the <command>source</command>
                command.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you develop a library of device support code, or are using
                someone else's device support code, it is probably preferable
                to use the Tcl <command>package</command> command,
                <filename>pkgIndex.tcl</filename> and package search paths
                to load the driver code.
            </para>
            <para>
                The author of the driver code you are using must have cooperated
                to the extent of having a <command>package provide</command>
                command in their scripts, and creating a <filename>pkgIndex.tcl</filename>
                (through e.g. Tcl's <command>pkg_mkIndex</command> command) in the
                directories holding their packagtes.
            </para>
            <para>
                Once this is done you can append the script package directories
                to your <varname>auto_path</varname> variable and use
                <command>package require</command> to pull in the required
                files.
            </para>
            <para>
                Suppose, for example, <filename>/projects/mydetector/drivers</filename>
                is a directory that contains several device support scripts
                given package names like <literal>device1</literal>
                <literal>device2</literal>, suppose further that you are
                running in conjunction with another system that has
                <literal>device3</literal> in <filename>/projects/otherdetector/drivers</filename>.
                The following script fragment uses the Tcl package facility to load
                those drivers:
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <programlisting>
lappend auto_path /projects/mydetector/drivers /projects/otherdetector/drivers

package require device3
                </programlisting>
            </informalexample>
            <para>
                Furthermore, by using the <literal>TCLLIBPATH</literal>
                rather than the <varname>auto_path</varname> variable you
                can make it so that your script does not need to know
                which directories have package files.
            </para>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Creating device instances</title>
                <para>
                    How you create device instances depends on how you the
                    driver was written.  In snit, for example you use the
                    <command>snit::type</command> type name's create
                    sub command.  For example for the previous example driver:

            <informalexample>

            <para>
                creates an instance of the driver named <literal>snitmarker</literal>.
                The base name of the resulting command ensemble is also
                <command>snitmarker</command>.
                In the case of our Incr Tcl driver:
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <programlisting>
marker-itcl itclmarker

            </informalexample>
            <para>
                Creates an instance whose name is <literal>itclmarker</literal>
                and whose instance command is
                <command>itclmarker</command>
            </para>
            <para>
                Once created, how you configure the device depends on the
                framework used to build the driver.  For both the
                snit and Incr Tcl examples, the <command>configure</command>
                command can be used to configure  the object instance:

            There is nothing to stop you from creating device support that
            does not do anything in its <methodname>addReadoutList</methodname>.
            You could do this to implement static controls devices.  That is
            non data taking devices whose configuration is set up at the start of
            a run and cannot be dynamically modified.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are cases, however when you'd like to have some control
            panel associated with a device, that would provide a virtual knob
            allowing you to dynamically modify settings in the device.
            The slow controls subsystem supports this by offering a
            TCP/IP server which can accept commands to set and query
            devices.  
        </para>
        <para>
            If the run is halted, the slow controls server can directly
            manipulate the CCUSB to perform the desired device changes.
            If, however the CCUSB is in data taking mode, the slow controls
            server pauses the run, makes the setting and then resumes the run.
            You should avoid working with control panels during production runs
            for that reason.

        <para>
            The philosophy of the slow controls subsystem is similar to that
            of the readout subsystem.  A controls configuration file defines
            the control modules present in the system and their unchanging
            configuration.  Note that the controls configuration file
            is read only as CCUSBReadout starts, not once per run as
            for the data acquisition configuration file.

            The <command>Module</command> command is used to create configure
            and query the configuration of slow controls devices known to the server.

                come into existence.  The <command>Module</command> makes use
                of an extensible driver factory.  A set of creator objects

                        Let's start by looking at the class definition for the
                        driver itself.  First we'll give a brief overview of the
                        methods the driver must define.  Then we will look at
                        the implementation of each method with an eye towards
                        what the method is expected to do.

                        make much sense for your driver, you can implement it
                        as a method that does nothing, but you must implement
                        all virtual methods.

                            to satisfy client <command>Set</command> requests that
                            are directed at this module name.  Normal drivers
                            will take the parameter name and value and use them
                            to set some device state.

                        Our driver instance uses its configuration parameters
                        as the settable parameters rather than hardware.
                        Note that when called the <methodname>Set</methodname>
                        method can be assured that data taking is not active.
                        If there is an active run, the framework pauses it
                        before calling <methodname>Set</methodname> and
                        resumes it when that method returns.

                                line, a real driver would use the
                                <parameter>parameter</parameter> argument to
                                select a bit of device state and set that

            Before continuing with a detailed discussion of pure Tcl drivers,
            it is important to understand Tcl command ensembles.  A command
            ensemble is a command that has subcommands.  Traditionally, the
            subcommand is the second keyword on the command line.
            The Tcl
            <ulink url='http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/string.htm'>
                string</ulink> command is an example ofa  command ensemble
            that is part of the core lanaguage.
        </para>
        <para>
            All Tcl slow controls drivers must be Tcl command ensembles that
            implement some pre-defined subcommands.  When writing Tcl drivers,
            it is useful to have an <firstterm>ensemble generator</firstterm>.
            An ensemble generator is a mechanism that generates command ensembles
            that follow the form of some template.  For example, all
            Tk user interface creation commands (e.g.
            <ulink url='http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/canvas.htm'>canvas</ulink>)
            are ensemble generators.  The widget they create becomes a Tcl command
            that at least has the <command>config</command> and
            <command>cget</command> subcommands.

            For example, in instances of an incrTcl <literal>class</literal>,
            public methods of that class are ensemble subcommands for the name of
            the object.  Similarly, for objects generated by
            <literal>snit::type</literal> class commands, the methods of that
            type are ensemble methods of the generated command.

        <para>
            The remainder of this section describes a sample Tcl driver written
            in Tcl that is similar in functionality to the sample driver written
            in C++ described in the previous section. We'll use this sample driver
            as a mechanism to describe and discuss the interfaces between the
            sample driver and the framework.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that sample drivers perform CCUSB operations via the SWIG
            wrappers for the CCCUSB class.  They can generate and perform lists
            as well by using the SWIG wrapping of the CCUSBReadoutList class.
            This section assumes you are familiar with those wrappers.
        </para>
        <para>
            We are going to approach the description of the driver by first
            showing a skeletal <command>snit::type</command> and then filling
            in the body of each method.  Finally we'll show some script fragments
            that show how to create instances of the type and how to integrate those
            instances into the slow controls framework.
        </para>
        <para>
            The example below is a snit driver with all of the executable code
            stripped out.  This shows the general structure of the driverand
            its methods.

            It is no accident that there is a close parallel between the names of
            the methods for the Tcl driver and those of a C++ class that
            implements a slow control driver.

                    This section of code defines three options much like the
                    C++ sample driver does. The <option>-default</option> option
                    provides a default value for the option, effectively initializing
                    that element of the <varname>options</varname> array.
                    The <option>-configuremethod</option> option provides a
                    method that is automatically called when an option is
                    configured via the <command>configure</command> sub-command.
                    We will use these methods to validate  a proposed new

                    however, methods with names that begin with

                    Drivers are expected to define a set of named parameters
                    that can be read.  These need not be the same as the set
                    that can be written. <parameter>what</parameter> should be
                    the name of one of these defined parameters.  On success, the
                    driver should return the value of that parameter. On failure
                    the driver should either execute an <command>error</command> comman

            <title>construction</title>
            <para>
                Construction should be used to initialize the driver's internal
                state.  Furthermore, the <methodname>configurelist</methodname>
                predefined method can be used to process the configuration arguments
                passed to the constructor.

        </formalpara>
        <example>

        <formalpara>
            <title>Initialization</title>
            <para>
                Since we have no hardware we have no one-type initialization
                of that hardware.  Note that if we did have to initialize
                hardware the <parameter>crate</parameter> parameter can be
                used to perform the CAMAC operations needed to do that
                initialization.

        <formalpara>
            <title>Update</title>
            <para>
                We don't have anything to do on Update.  In this case it's best
                to make Update signal and error because clients should be
                written not to use it for this device.
            </para>
            </formalpara>
        <example>
            <title>CCUSB Tcl Slow Controls Update</title>
            <programlisting>
method Update crate {
    error "This device does not support 'Update'"
}
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            In this case we use the <command>error</command> command to signal
            the error.  The Tcl module will catch this error and turn it into
            the string
            <literal>ERROR - This device does not support 'Update'</literal>.
            We could have also directly returned that string.
        </para>
        <para>
            If the <command>Update</command> method was legal for this driver,
            and it executed successfully, we should return the string that we
            want the client to get.  This is normally <literal>OK</literal>
            indicating success.
        </para>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Set</title>
            <para>
                In our case, <command>Set</command> will treat
                <parameter>what</parameter> like a configuration
                parameter name and <parameter>value</parameter> like
                the value to use to set the parameter.
                We are just going to do a <command>$self configure</command>
                and let this produce an error if there are problems
                (illegal configuration options, illegal values).
                If we succeed, we'll return <literal>OK</literal> to indicate
                that.
            </para>
        </formalpara>
        <para>
            Normally we'd need to use the <parameter>crate</parameter> parameter
            to perform actual CAMAC operations.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>CCUSB Tcl Slow controls driver Set</title>
            <programlisting>
method Set {crate what value} {
    $self configure $what $value
    return "OK"
}
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Get</title>
            <para>
                The <command>Get</command> will treat the <parameter>what</parameter>
                parameter as the name of a configuration option.  If that option
                exists it will be returned, otherwise an error message will be
                generated.
            </para>
        </formalpara>
        <example>
            <title>CCUSB Tcl Slow Control driver Get</title>
            <programlisting>
method Get {crate what} {
    if {[array names options $what] ne ""} {
        return $options($what)
    } else {
        error "No such parameter '$what'"
    }
}
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            Note that in <command>snit::type</command>s, the <varname>options</varname>
            array contains the configuration options. The Tcl command
            <command>array names</command> returns the names of array indices
            that match a glob pattern.  We can get fooled into not emitting the
            correct error message if, for example, we are asked to get
            <literal>*anint</literal>.  In that case there will be a match with
            <literal>-anint</literal>, and the error produced will be:
            <literal>ERROR - can't read "options(*anint)": no such element in array</literal>
        </para>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Option value checking.</title>
            <para>
                In our C++ driver we used configuration constraints to enforce
                correctness in the form and values of the configuration options.
                Tcl rivers are not able to take advantage of the capabilities of
                a <classname>CConfigurableObject</classname>.  Therefore,
                the onus of ensuring that options are correct is placed on
                the driver.
            </para>
        </formalpara>
        <para>
            <command>snit::type</command> provides the ability to intercept
            the <command>configure</command> (and for that matter the <command>cget</command>)
            operations on an option by option basis.  This is done using the
            <option>-configuremethod</option> when defining an option.
        </para>
        <para>
            Configure methods are responsible for updating (or
            not) the appropriate element of the
            <varname>options</varname> array and can therefore
            reject proposed changes.
            Configure methods receive as parameters the name of
            the option being configured and the new proposed value.
            This allows options to share configuremethods.
        </para>

            We are going to further share code by having a helper function
            that will throw an error if a string is not an integer.  This
            helper will be used by both <methodname>_CheckInt</methodname> and
            <methodname>_CheckIntList</methodname>.  For now we will assume
            that <methodname>_CheckIntList</methodname> needs to see a 16
            element list.  If this method needs to validate several lists
            that are of different lengths, we would define a <command>variable</command>
            for the object that would be an array indexed by option name whose
            values would be the lengths of the list.

      <title>The ccusbcamac Tcl package </title>
      <anchor id="intro.ccusbcamac"/>
      <para>
        Now that you have been introduced to the slow-controls server and how to
        write your own custom drivers to work with it, we will discuss a fully
        implemented example of how this system might be used.  In the 
        <link linkend="ccusb.slowcontrols.intro">Slow controls subsystem section</link>,
        you were shown the <command>Module</command> command and instructed on how 
        it can be used to register a slow-controls driver for a CAMAC discriminator. 
        It can also be used to create a module of type <literal>ccusb</literal>, which 
        is a module that enables remote control over the CC-USB from a client program. 
        This chapter will focus on the the <literal>ccusbcamac</literal> Tcl package, 
        which provides a client-side API to execute remote CAMAC commands through the 
        <literal>ccusb</literal> module.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>ccusbcamac</literal> package provides an API compatible with 
        the <literal>camac</literal> and <literal>wienercamac</literal> packages. It is 
        therefore intended to be a drop in replacement for those two. 
        The <literal>ccusbcamac</literal> package allows Tcl scripts to send
        remote commands to the CC-USB device attached to the slow-controls server
        it is connected to in a transparent way.
      </para>
      <para>
        The package can be used to communicate with up to 56, unrelated CAMAC 
        crates at the same time. Each of these crates is uniquely identified
        by a pair of branch ane crate indices. It is important to understand that 
        there are no physical CAMAC branches being referred to. Instead, the branch
        and crate indices are used to uniquely identify a specific crate and
        to store the connection information with it. A major benefit of maintaining
        the branch and crate parameters is the maintaining of compatibility with the
        <literal>camac</literal> and <literal>wienercamac</literal> packages.

        <para>
          There are two ways to manipulate the Tcl interpreter package load
          search path.  The environment variable <varname>TCLLIBPATH</varname>
          is a space separated set of additional directories to search for packages.
          The Tcl global variable <varname>auto_path</varname> is one of the
          several Tcl variables that control the package search path.
        </para>
        <para>
          From now on we will assume that the environment variable
          <varname>DAQROOT</varname> has been defined to point to the
          top level of the NSCLDAQ installation directory tree.
          A bash shell script fragment that shows how to append the
          NSCLDAQ Tcl package repository and lib path to the <varname>TCLLIBPATH</varname>
          environment variable is shown below:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
            export TCLLIBPATH="$TCLLIBPATH $DAQROOT/TclLibs $DAQROOT/lib"
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
          Similarly the code to add the NSCLDAQ Tcl package repository and 
          lib directory to the <varname>auto_path</varname> interpreter global is shown
          below:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
            global env
            global auto_path
            lappend auto_path [file join $env(DAQROOT) TclLibs]
            lappend auto_path [file join $env(DAQROOT) lib]
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
          Once these directories have been added to the
          repository search path, an explicit <command>package require</command>
          as shown below must be issued prior to using the package commands:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
            package require ccusbcamac
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
          The commands defined by <literal>ccusbcamac</literal> are
          defined in the <literal>ccusbcamac::</literal> namespace.
          The examples in the next section will use fully qualified command
          names (e.g. <command>::ccusbcamac::cdreg 1 1</command>).  It is
          also possible to import the commands from that namespace
          using the <command>namespace import</command> command.
          If you are also using the <literal>wienercamac</literal> or <literal>camac</literal> 
          package, this is not advisable as both packages share many of the same command names.
        </para>

      <section>
        <title>Using ccusbcamac</title>
        <para>
          The ccusbcamac package is the client code to the slow-controls
          server in the CCUSBReadout program. All communication with the 
          server is via the TCP/IP protocol and must proceed after a connection
          has been established. The server-side handler is the CCCUSBControl
          class, which must be registered to the slow controls server by adding
          a line to the controlconfig.tcl script such as:
        </para>
        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
            Module create ccusb ctlr
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        <para>
          The example creates a new control module named "ctlr" and is of type
          ccusb. In order to establish a functional connection, the name of
          the module, the name of the host running the server, and the port
          on which it listens must be provided to the ccusbcamac package. 
          These three pieces of connection information are associated and stored with a 
          branch and crate index by the <command>cdconn</command>
          command. This leads us to the major difference between the <literal>ccusbcamac</literal>
          package and the <literal>wienercamac</literal>
          packages that affects the user. The difference is that the 
          <command>cdconn</command> command MUST be
          called prior to any other methods for a given branch and crate index combination. 
          If for some reason the
          user forgets to call <command>cdconn</command> prior to calling <command>cdreg</command>, they
          will be presented with an error. It is not essential, but it is not
          a bad idea to check whether or not the server is accepting connections
          before calling <command>cdreg</command> using the <command>isOnline</command>
          procedure.
        </para>
        <para>
          The commands in the package are loosely based on a subset of the
          ESONE CAMAC function standard (IEEE 785).  In that standard, the unit
          of address is a single CAMAC module.  The <command>cdreg</command>
          produces a handle to a module which is then used in subsequent
          commands that operate on that module. Extensions to the standard
          include commands that allow you to get the graded lam register values,
          sense and control the inhibit and determine if the crate is online.
        </para>
        <para>
          While the ESONE block transfer functions are supported, connecting
          a LAM to a script is not.  The example below enables the LAM on a module
          in Slot 15 of the crate labeled by the user as branch 0 and crate 1.

	       to <literal>n</literal>.
	       If this is not set correctly, the Readout program will
	       not be able to communicate with the module and will emit
	       a warning, if the slot <literal>n</literal> is empty.

	    <listitem>
	       <para>
		  Sets the id of the module to <literal>n</literal>.
		  The module id is placed as a marker word prior
		  to the data from the module.  It is used by the
		  unpacking software to unambiguously identify The
		  data from each module.  For the C1205, the id
		  value is also programmed into the lower 8 bits of the
		  control status register and will therefore also
		  appear in the bottom 8 bits of the header word
		  read from the module.
	       </para>
	       <para>
		  While the <option>-id</option> value defaults to
		  0, and need not be unique, your data is most
		  reliably decoded if each module in your system has
		  a unique id value.

		  is selected.
		  High resolution
		  mode provides 12 bits of data resolution while low

	     This command ensemble allows you to create and configure
	     CAEN model C257 scaler modules.  The C257 is a 16 channel
	     scaler module.  Support is intended to be used with the
	     scaler stack.  The C257 is capable of cascading channels
	     to produce very wide counters, however this mode is not supported
	     by this release of the software limiting the width of each
	     scaler to 24 bits.  Thus, to use the module with this
	     software requires that all of the module jumpers be set to the

		  channel Time digitizer.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		  The <command>create</command> command
		  allows you to create a new module and assign a
		  <parameter>module-name</parameter> to it so that it can
		  be referred to in subsequent configuration commands.
		  You may optionally include configuration switch value pairs
		  on the <command>create</command> command line.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		  The <command>config</command> subcommand allows you to
		  set the configuration parameters for an existing module.
		  <parameter>module-name</parameter> is the name assigned to
		  that module whe it was created.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		  The <command>cget</command> command returns as its value
		  the module configuration as a Tcl list where each list element
		  is a sublist containing the name and value of a configuration
		  parameter.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		  Configuration options are name/value pairs.   The name
		  of a configuration option is sometimes called a
		  <firstterm>switch</firstterm> because it resembles the
		  command line switches of command shell commands.
		  For a full description of these options see OPTIONS below.

              <para>
         	Creates and configures CC-USB stacks.  Stacks are lists of
                CAMAC operations that are loaded into the CC-USB for autonomous
                execution.  There are two types of stacks; an
                <firstterm>event</firstterm> stack that is executed when
                a front panel trigger or a specified LAM is detected, and
                a <firstterm>scaler</firstterm> stack that can be periodically
                triggered.
              </para>
               <para>
                  Stacks contain lists of modules.  The modules themselves
                  determine the set of readout instructions that make up each
                  stack.  
               </para>
               <para>
                  The <command>create</command> subcommand creates a new stack.
                  The name of the new stack is <replaceable>name</replaceable>.
                  This <replaceable>name</replaceable> will be used to refer to
                  this stack in future configuration commands.
               </para>
               <para>
                  The <command>config</command> subcommand configures the stack
                  <replaceable>name</replaceable>.  The configuration is
                  specified as a set of option value pairs.  The options
                  are described in the section OPTIONS below.
               </para>
               <para>
                  The <command>cget</command> subcommand returns the configuration
                  of the stack <replaceable>name</replaceable> as its command value.
                  This subcommand is intended for advanced applications that may
                  analyze the configuration of the stack.  The configuration is
                  returned as a properly formatted Tcl list.  Each element of the list
                  is itself a two element sublist (pair).  The first element of each
                  pair is the name of a configuration parameter the second, that
                  configuration parameter's value.  Note that the value may itself
                  be a list.

                  Options are used to configure the stack.  Each option has associated
                  with it a keyword that selects it and a value.  The option s supported
                  by the <command>stack</command> command are subdivided into three groups:

                           The CC-USB only supports one scaler and one event stack.
                           The current version of the configuration engine allows
                           you to create more than one of each stack. In that case,
                           it is not well defined which stacks are actually loaded.

                           I suggest leaving this value at zero, and deriving a
                           trigger signal for the NIM IN1 input as the readout
                           trigger.

                           <replaceable>microseconds</replaceable> specifies the

                           this LAM.  The value should be on the order of the
                           conversion time of the module.  Defaults to zero.

            In most cases the configuration of a slow control module is pretty
            minimal as the assumption is that there is a slow control
            panel associated with the device.  Typical configuration consists
            of a <option>-slot</option> which provides the CAMAC slot in which
            the module is installed and a <option>-file</option> which provides
            the initial settings of the device (the file is usually maintained
            by the control panel).  Note that the <literal>ph7106</literal>
            currently only supports the <option>-slot</option> option.

     <para>
The CamacCrate command defines a container-type driver that holds a registry of modules. It is designed to make it trivial to convert a daqconfig.tcl script that sets up a crate running on a CBD8210 branch to one being controlled by a CC-USB. Contrary to the CBDCamacCrate, this does not need to be registered to a CAMAC branch and can instead be loaded directly into a stack.
     </para>

  <para>
At the start of every run, the initialization procedures will be called for all of the registered modules in the order the modules were listed.
  </para>

  <para>
At the end of every run, the end of run procedures will be called for all of the registered module in the order the modules were listed.
  </para>

  <para>
During stack execution initiated by an event trigger, the event-wise procedures of each of the registered modules will be executed in the order that they were listed.

  <para>
  This provides control over a LeCroy 4300B FERA that lives in a crate controlled by a CC-USB. This is the counterpart to the CBDLeCroy4300B driver that is functional in the VMUSBReadout framework. The currently described driver needn't be registered to a CamacCrate to function. 
  </para>
  <para>
There are a number of options that are provided to ultimately control the command register of the device. The command register is what establishes how the FERA will read out its data. Two options must be specified to operate the device, -pedestals and slot. If either of these are not specified, the initialization of the module will fail. 
  </para>

  <para>
  During initialization the following operations occur:
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem> 
        <para> Clear the module </para>

     <listitem>

  </para>

  <para>

        By default, the ULM will only load the firmware if it fails to validate the configuration. This occurs always after a bad firmware load or after a crate has been power cycled. Firmware loads take a bit of time so it is worthwhile to skip reloading the firmware on every run. However, sometimes it may be considered useful. This option causes the firmware to be loaded at the start of EVERY run. Defaults to false.

           <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
           <para>
            The protocol which communicates with the slow control server is
            a set of commands that are submitted to a Tcl interpreter that
            is running in the server.  Three commands result in
            dispatch to slow controls drivers.  If the run is active, the dispatch
            to the driver functions is preceeded by pausing the run and
            succeeded by resuming the run.  This allows driver functions
            unimpeded access to the CCUSB.
           </para>
           <para>
            Each driver is assumed to implement a set of named parameters.
            These parameters have values which are passed to and from the
            driver without interpretation.  Commands that result errors return
            strings to the client that begin with the text <literal>ERROR - </literal>
            with an english error message appended to that prefix.

                            to update any internal state it maintains from the
                            device or, alternatively, depending on the driver
                            refresh any device state from internal state.
                            Normally this is used for devices that have write-only
                            registers, for those devices, typically the driver
                            must retain some concept of what it believes the
                            state of the physical device is.  This command is
                            then used to ensure the actual state of the device
                            matches the believed state.

          <para>
            The <classname>CCCUSB</classname> class represents a connection
            to a CC-USB controller.  The static members <methodname>enumerate</methodname>
            and <methodname>serialNo</methodname> allow programs to become
            aware of the set of interfaces that are currently plugged in
            and powered up, and to associated them with serial number strings.
          </para>
          <para>
            Constructing an object around a specific <classname>usb_device*</classname>
            allows you to interact with the device represented by that struct.
            The class exports a rich set of methods which are described in the
            METHODS section below.  Bits and bit fields are defined as class
            constants described in PUBLIC VARIABLES, TYPES and CONSTANTS below.

          <para>
            In the functions listed below, any function that returns an <type>int</type>
            returns <literal>0</literal> on success, <literal>-1</literal> if
            the write operation to the device failed or <literal>-2</literal>
            if the read operation failed.  Negative values result in the
            <varname>errno</varname> variable set to the actual reason for the
            failure.

                            When this bit is set, the CC-USB enters data taking
                            mode.  In data taking mode the CC-USB responds to triggers
                            for the Event and Scaler stacks by executing them
                            and buffering their data for read via
                            <methodname>usbRead</methodname>.  Prior
                            to executing immediate actions you must clear this
                            bit and drain any buffered event data from the
                            module.

                The manual (3.3.4) refers to this as tyhe ACS control register,

                (Auxilliary stack) is triggered.
                There are two fields. Both can be non-zero allowing for two
                trigger conditions.  One trigger condition allows scalers to
                be triggered after a fixed number of events have been read.
                The second condition allows readout of scalers at fixed time
                intervals.
            </para>
            <para>
                If a field is zero, that trigger condition is disabled.

            <para>
                This register contains several fields that control the
                input sources to the scalers and gate and delay generators
                implemented in the CC-USB.  The register contains four fields
                which are called <literal>scalerA</literal>, <literal>scalerB</literal>
                <literal>dggA</literal>  and <literal>dggB</literal>. Typically
                you will bitwise or a code from each of the fields.  In the case
                of the scaler fields there are three bits, <literal>Enable</literal>,
                <literal>Reset</literal>, and <literal>FreezeReg</literal>
                that can also be ored into the codes.

                            capability is of limited utility.

                Several registers are used to set the timing of gate and
                delay registers.  The timing parameters for gate and delay
                generator A also determine the timing for the pulser as showin
                in section 3.3.7 of the CC-USB manual.

            <para>
                This section describes the bit fields in these registers.
                Each field is descdribed as a mask and shift count.
                The mask removes all extraneous bits from the register except
                the desired field and the shift count, when used to shift the
                result right right justifies the field data.

          <para>
          This class is the low level support for the Wiener/JTEC CCUSB module.
          the CCUSB is a USB CAMAC controller.  To use this class you must first locate
          a module by invoking enumerate.  enumerate  returns a vector of
          usb_device*s.   One of those can be used to instantiate the CCCUSBusb 
          object which can the ben operated on.
          </para>
          <para>
          Most all of the functionality is implemented in te base class CCCUSB. 
          The methods defined in this class are the minimum needed to be implemented
          in order to attach to a locally connected usb device (i.e. the usb device
          is directly connected to the computer).

                            the number of milliseconds in the new timeout.

           This class provides remote access to the CC-USB through the
           CCUSBModule support in the tcl server.
           An external program can link to libCCUSB, instantiate
           this class and pretty much have its way with the CC-USB
           as if it owned it.

                            The writeAction register method is not fully implemented in the CCCUSBRemote.
                            It maintains an implementation that does nothing more than print a message
                            to the screen stating that it does nothing.

                            Constructs a new readout list from a raw list of stack commands. 
                            The contents of the list passed into the constructor will be copied into
                            the list managed by this object. All subsequent commands will be appended
                            to the new list.

                          Adds an address pattern read to the stack. The data
                          read by the provided NAF is interpreted as a list of 
                          A values to use when calling the NAF of the
                          subsequent command in the stack. For each nonzero bit
                          in the data returned, the subsequent command's N and
                          F values are used with each of the present A values
                          to form an NAF command.  In other words, if the NAF
                          of this read returns a value of 0x7 and the next
                          command in the stack is N(4)AF(0), then three
                          commands will be executed in succession:
                          N(4)A(0)F(0), N(4)A(1)F(0), and N(4)A(2)F(0). Note
                          that this is a setup command for the next NAF
                          operation that is added to the stack. If the lamWait
                          is true, the read will wait until a LAM is identified
                          or a timeout occurs.

          <para>
            This class is the ultimate base class of the <classname>CReadoutModule</classname>
            object passed to device driver <methodname>onAttach</methodname> methods.
            It manages the configuration database of a configurable object.
          </para>
          <para>
            The interaction of a configurable object or an object that embeds
            configuration via delegation is:
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        The object defines a configuration that consists of
                        a set of named parameters and initial values.  Each
                        configuration value can have a constraint function
                        attached to it that is called prior to allowing the
                        value to assume a new value.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Through these constraint functions parameter values can'
                        be very strongly typed (e.g. not just parameter
                        must be an integer but parameter must be an integer
                        in this range).
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Pre packaged constraint functions and convenience functions
                        make it easy to set up most types of constraints, however
                        if something special is required client code can implement
                        a special constraint.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        At some point in the lifetime of a configurable object,
                        the object is configured.  This is usually done by creating
                        (the CCUSB framework does this for you) a command or
                        command ensemble that accepts configuration name/value
                        pairs and passes them to the <methodname>configure</methodname>
                        method.  This method will invoke the constraint checker
                        and, if successful, modify the value of the configuration
                        parameter.  If the new value fails the constraint, a
                        <type>std::string</type> exception is thrown and should
                        be caught and reported at some level by the caller.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Again for CCUSB device drivers this is transparent.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Configurable objects can query their configuration.
                        The constraint checkers ensure that each value has
                        the type and range constraints required of that parameter.
                        Semantics, however must be enforced and applied
                        by the object that
                        uses the configuration.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        It is always possible to get a stringified value for
                        each configuration item (in fact configuration items
                        are stored as strings).  Convenience methods allow
                        for clients to fetch conversions of those strings to
                        a rich set of types.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        CCUSB device drivers normally fetch and process their
                        configurations when their
                        <methodname>Initialize</methodname>
                        and <methodname>addReadoutList</methodname> methods
                        are invoked.

          <para>
            For the full set of methods see the METHODS section below.  The
            pre-defined constraint checkers additionally make use of
            several data types which are described in
            PUBLIC VARIABLES, TYPES and CONSTANTS further below.

                        Configurable objects have names to allow them to be

                        namespace the application maintains.  This is not
                        enforced by the constructor, however.

                        is the new proposed value of the parameter.
                        The constraint checker, if any, is called for that parameter
                        and if it fails a string exception is thrown.  Otherwise,
                        the new parameter value replaces the old one.

                Almost all of these types are structures used by the
                built in constraint checkers.In most cases,
                if you use the convenience functions to define your parameters
                you won't need to know the details of these types.

                When a parameter is created with <methodname>addParameter</methodname>,
                The caller has an option to provide a constraint checker and
                a parameter that provides extra information to the constraint
                checker that can parameterize the constraints it checks.

            <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
            <para>
                This set of commands is a Tcl wrapper around the
                CCCUSB C++ class (see <xref linkend='ccusb3-CCCUSB' />.  The
                interface consists of several static methods and object sub
                commands.
            </para>
            <para>
                The static methods include methods that support
                device enumeration and construction.  Enumeration returns
                data types that require additional static methods to
                unpack.  See DEVICE ENUMERATION below.
            </para>
            <para>
                Command lists (see <xref linkend='ccusb3-cccusbreadoutlist' />)
                can be executed in immediate mode or loaded.  At present
                the usb bulk read function is not supported so a pure Tcl
                data taking system cannot yet be written.  If you want support
                for that, request it as that can be added easily enough.
            </para>
            <para>
                Immediate list execution also produces data types that require
                additional static member functions to unpack.  See
                LIST EXECUTION below for more information.

                            Most CC-USB operations require a USB bulk transfer to
                            the CC-USB and a transfder from the CC-USB.  These
                            transfers are done with a timeout so that if
                            the target does not respond, the request eventually
                            does terminate. This sets the timeout for

            <para>
                The USB bus is a hotplug bus.  Device enumeration is the
                process of determining the set of devices plugged into the USB
                bus at a point in time.  The goal of device enumeration is normally
                to access a specific device of the desired device type.
                In our case we are interested in creating a CCCUSB object
                connected to  CC-USB with a specific serial number.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you are using the CCUSBReadout framework, you normally don't
                need to do this.   The framework has already enumerated and
                opened the device and is passes you the appropriate object id.
                If you are writing a pure Tcl CC-USB application, you will need
                to read and understand this section.
            </para>
            <para>
                The starting point of device enumeration is the
                <command>cccusb::CCCUSB_enumerate</command>  command.
                This returns an object id for a
                <type>std::vector&lt;usb_device*&gt;</type>. This is unfortunately
                not directly accessible in Tcl.

                the cccusb package provides two commands to tear apart the

            <para>
                Once you have a <type>usb_device</type> pointer object id
                you can do two things with it.  You can obtain the serial
                number string of the associated CC-USB controller or create
                a CCCUSB object with which you can perform operations on the
                controller and the CAMAC modules in its crate.
            </para>
            <para>
                Normally you want to do both, you want to enumerate the
                controllers and either match them against a desired serial
                number or display them for the user to choose.
                The example below enumerates the CC-USB's and displays
                their serial numbers on stdout:

                The pattern of this code follows the pattern of the previous
                example.  The only difference is that when the serial number
                matches the requested <varname>serialNo</varname> parameter,
                a CCCUSB object is created.  SWIG is allowed to choose the
                object command (the <option>-args</option> option does that),
                which is returned to the caller.

                values that will be read by the list.  This is used to allocate
                the read buffer.  The actual count of the words read is then
                used to fill the vector returned by that command.

            <para>
                This Tcl package is a SWIG wrapper around the
                <classname>CCCUSBReadoutList</classname> C++ package.
                The purpose of this class is to construct list of CC-USB
                operations which can either be executed immediately or
                loaded for execution in response to an event or scaler trigger
                in data taking mode.
            </para>
            <para>
                This extension is an object oriented package.  Users construct
                lists, they stock them with commands, execute or load them and
                then destroy the list.

          <para>
            This class provides a factory that allows the
            <command>Module create</command> slow control server command to
            instantiate driver objects from the name of the class.
            The factory operates by matching a driver type with a
            <link linkend='ccusb3-cmodulecreator'>creator object</link>.
            The creator object then instantiates the actual object.

            this class are matched up with object type names (used in the
            <command>Module create</command> command) and are responsible for
            creating objects of the specified type.

         <para>
           CCCUSBControl allows arbitrary CAMAC access by a client and is the receiver of 
           commands executed by the CCCUSBRemote class. The only method implemented
           with functionality is Set. All of the other methods do nothing. The idea is that a set command
           will provide a remote procedure call for the CCCUSB::executeList method.
           The syntax is

           Note that this function can therefore also provide all single shot operations as those are just
           lists with one element... however if the run is active each list execution will pause/resume
           the run so be aware and use with caution.

           Performs a CAMAC operation on the module <parameter>reg</parameter>.
           <parameter>reg</parameter> is a module handle created by a call to
           <command>cdreg</command>.  If the function transfers data the least
           significant 24 bits of data are transferred.  If the function is a write
           operation, the <parameter>d</parameter> parameter is required and is the
           data to write.
         </para>
         <para>
           The return value is a 3 element Tcl list.  The second element of the list
           is the Q response.  The third element of the list is the X response. The
           meaning of the first element of the list depends on the <parameter>f</parameter>
           parameter.  If <parameter>f</parameter> is the read operation, this
           will be the value read from the module.  If <parameter>f</parameter> is
           a write operation, this will be the <parameter>d</parameter> parameter.
           If <parameter>f</parameter> is a control operation (non data transfer),
           this will be zero.

         <para>
           Identical to <command>ccusbcamac::cfsa</command> however all data transfers
           only transfer the least significant 16 bits.  Since the data path to the
           controller is only 16 bits, this is significantly faster than 24 bit transfers
           when the top bits are not required.

         <para>
           Performs the same read operation until the operation no longer returns
           a Q.  If the optional <parameter>maxn</parameter> parameter is present
           this also sets an upper limit in the number of transferrs.  The return
           value from this is a list of the data read from the module.  Only read functions
           are suportedby this and all block functions. At the moment, these only
           support 16-bit dataway operations.

         <para>
           Performs a Qscan block transfer.  After each read operation,
           the subaddress is incremented.  Once a module no longer responds
           with a Q, the subaddress is reset to zero and the slot is incremented.
           This continues until no X response is returned.  If the optional
           parameter <parameter>maxn</parameter> is provided, it limits the
           maximum transfer count to <parameter>maxn</parameter>. At the moment,
           these only support 16-bit dataway operations.
         </para>

           The return value is a list of data that was returned from the module.
