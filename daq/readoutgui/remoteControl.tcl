# @brief Package to layer a Tcp/IP remote control server on the ReadoutGUI

# @class ReadoutGuiRemoteControl
#
# This snit::type layers a remote control server on top of the ReadoutGUI.  The
# server is largely compatible with the S800 server, however the port is
# allocated/registerd by the port allocator making it possible to do service
# location.
#
# The companion to this is the s800rctl class which serves as the backbone for
# the master readoutgui side of the remote control package. The s800Provider and
# RemoteGUI provider both are wrappers around that class. This forms the side of
# the remote control package utilized on the enslaved readout gui. 
#
# It listens for connections on a server socket and when a connection arrives,
# it accepts the first connection and then also tries to create a second
# connection. the first connection is for receiving requests from the master and
# the second connection is for send requests to the master. The communication
# between the two is implemented with symmetric transactions, meaning that any
# request made will expect the recipient to send a reply. These are 1-to-1
# connections. Also, the sockets maintained by this class are configured to be
# non-blocking. One might consider, however, that this implements a form of soft
# blocking. After a request is made, the execution will halt until the complete
# reply has been received. It is "soft" blocking rather than a true blocking
# scheme because all the while it is waiting for the response, the tcl event
# loop is active and processing events. In this way, we avoid locking up.
#
# @note as with the S800 remote control interface, only one 
#       connection is allowed at a time.
