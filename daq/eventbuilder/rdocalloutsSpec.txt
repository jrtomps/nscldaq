Event orderer callouts design specifications:

This is a loadable package that can be loaded via from a readoutcallouts script
given that TCLLIBPATH or some other mechanism has added $DAQROOT/TclLibs to the
Tcl search path.

package require evbcallouts

Provides

Low layer.

EVBC::start options - start the orderer pipeline

-teering ring       - if provided teering is inserted in the pipeline between
                      the orderer
-glombuild true     - If true glom builds if not it ignores dt.  defaults to false
-glomdt    int      - the GLOM build time (required)
-destring  ring     - Destination ring where the glommed data goes. defaults to 
                      your username (localhost)

e.g.

   EVBC::start -glomdt 100

 will start a pipeline that looks like:
      orderer | glom --dt 100 --nobuild |stdintoring `whoami`

   EVB::start -glomdt 100 -teering sortedFragments -glombuild true -glomdt 100 -destring assembledEvents

 will start a pipeline that looks like:
   orderer | teering --ring sortedFragments |glom --dt 100 |stdintoring assembledEvents

EVBC::stop   - stop the orderer pipeline
EVBC::reset  - Reset the orderer pipeline.
EVBC::flush  - Flush the orderer pipeline.

EVBC:startRingSource  sourceringurl timstampextractorlib id short long



The second layer provides:

EVBC::onBegin
EVBC::onEnd
EVBC::initialize options
  Options are:
  -gui false - Does not provide an event builder parameter gui (see below).
  -restart false - Implies -gui false if not provided, the event builder is not restarted by 
   EVBC::onBegin, however an EVBC::reset is done.
  Any option accepted by EVBC::start which sets the initial values in the GUI if its
  Provided or the actual EVBC::start parameters if -gui false is used.

Where initialize adds a GUI strip to control the parameters of the
EVBC::start command.

EVBC::onBegin 
  - Stops any running event builder pipeline.
  - Starts a new event builder pipeline as described by the GUI
  - If the proc "startEVBSources" is defined, calls that so that users
    can start event sources (e.g. EVB::startRingSource).
  - Disables GUI strip so that you can't think you'll be making changes in the middle of the run.

EVBC::onEnd
  - invokes EVBC::flush
  - Re-enables the GUI strip so that the next instance of the event builder can run with different parameters.
