    <para>
        The state manager control panel connects to the state manager.
        See <link linkend='chap.statemgr' endterm='chap.statemgr.title' /> for
        information about the state manager.  For the manpage on the control
        panel see
        <link linkend='daq1-cpanel' endterm='daq1-cpanel-title' />
    </para>
    <para>
        The state manager provides a display that describes the current system
        state as well as providing a context sensitive set of buttons that
        allow you to request all legal state transitions for the current state.
        Since the control panel gets state and transition publications, you can
        start more than one panel and all panels will continue to be consistent
        regardless of which panel initiates transitions.
    </para>
    <para>
        The control panel (cpanel) needs to have a set of environment definitions made
        to run correctly.  To get those definitions made, source the
        <filename>daqsetup.bash</filename> script from the top level directory of
        the NSCLDAQ installation tree.
    </para>
    <para>
        cpanel determines how to connect to the state manager by following
        the procedure below:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                If the <option>--state_uri</option> and <option>--transition-uri</option>
                are both defined, they are used as the URI's for the state/transition
                publication port and the transition request port respectively.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                If the above conditions are not satisified,
                and the <option>--host</option>, <option>--state-service</option>
                and <option>--transition-service</option> options are all
                defined, the port manager is used to obtain the ports so that
                the appropriate URI's can be constructed.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                If the previous condition is not satisfied, cpanel will attempt
                to obtain the values of the environment variables:
                <literal>TRANSITION_SUBSCRIPTION_URI</literal> and
                <literal>TRANSITION_REQUEST_URI</literal> and use
                them as the state/transtion publication and transition
                request port URI's respectively.  Note that if cpanel
                is run from the boot manager, the boot manager will have
                defined these environment variables.  Note as well, that
                at least one control panel must not be run from the boot  manager
                because the system has to be booted somehow.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                If the previous condition is not satisfied, cpanel will
                attempt to connect to the user's state manager in
                <literal>localhost</literal> using the state manager's
                default service names to look up the ports needed.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
        Typically, in addition to the state manager, you will want
        the boot  manager running prior to asking the state manager
        to make state transitions.  Let's look at a typical sequence of
        bringing up the experiment (booting it), starting and stopping data taking
        and then shutting down the experiment.  We're going to assum you've
        just started the state and boot managers so that the system is in the
        <literal>NotReady</literal> state.
    </para>
    <para>
        The figure below shows what cpanel looks like when it is started:
        <informalfigure>
            
            <mediaobject>
               <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref='cpanel-notready.jpg' format='JPEG' />
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalfigure>
        At the right side of its window, the control panel will always display
        the current state.  The buttons appropriate to that state will
        be at the left side of the window.  The <guibutton>Boot</guibutton> button
        will request that the state manager take a <literal>BOOT</literal>
        transition to the <literal>Booting</literal> state.  From there the
        boot manager will take over, create rings and processes and initiate
        a transition to the <literal>Ready</literal> state.
    </para>
    <para>
        The figure below shows what cpanel looks like when the system is in the
        <literal>Ready</literal> state.
        <informalfigure>

                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalfigure>
        There are now two buttons:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><guibutton>Begin</guibutton>  requests a
                <literal>BEGIN</literal> transition to the <literal>Active</literal>
                state.   Readout program that are hooked into the state manager
                will use that to begin data taking.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem><para><guibutton>Fail</guibutton> can be clicked if you
                think something is wrong.  It initiates a <literal>FAIL</literal>
                transition that drops the system back into the <literal>NotReady</literal>
                state.  The boot manager will catch that transition and stop all
                programs.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
        If you click <guibutton>Begin</guibutton> to start the run, the
        control panel window will look like this:
        <informalfigure>
    
            <mediaobject>
               <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref='cpanel-active.jpg' format='JPEG' />
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </informalfigure>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><guibutton>End</guibutton> when clicked will
            request an <literal>END</literal> transition which will take the
            system back to the <literal>Ready</literal> state.  State aware
            readout programs stop data taking when they observe that transition.
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><guibutton>Fail</guibutton> when clicked requests
            a <literal>FAIL</literal> transition to the <literal>NotReady</literal>
            state.
            </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
        Once a run is ended, a new run can be started. The system can also be
        shutdown by clicking the <guibutton>Fail</guibutton> button at any time.

           <para>
            Control panel for the state and boot managers.   Provides
            a very simple GUI that can be used to control the state manager
            and run it through it states via allowed transitions.
           </para>
           <para>
            See <literal>OPTIONS</literal> below for the command line options.
            Just a note first about how cpanel locates the state manager with
            which it will interact.

                        If the previous condition is not satisfied, cpanel will attempt

                        <literal>TRANSITION_REQUEST_URI</literal> and use
                        them as the state/transtion publication and transition
                        request port URI's respectively.  Note that if cpanel
                        is run from the boot manager, the boot manager will have
                        defined these environment variables.  Note as well, that
                        at least one control panel must not be run from the boot  manager
                        because the system has to be booted somehow.
