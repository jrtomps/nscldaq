    <title>The Event log program</title>
    <para>
        Most experiments will record event data.  Event data files are
        record the data taken from the experiment event by event.
        The format of event data files is identical to the format of data in
        ring buffers.
        See the chapter:
        <link linkend="chapter.ringformat">Format of EventData In Ring Buffers</link>
        for a description of what to expect in an event file.   The
        <filename>$DAQROOT/include/DataFormat.h</filename> header is
        also helpful as it provides C/C++ structure definitions for
        data in ring buffers and event files.
    </para>
    <para>
        The event logger takes data from any ring (local or remote via the
        networked proxy ring subsystem).  When a begin run item is seen,
        a new event file is started.  Event files are broken into segments.
        This is done to ensure that files do not exceed maximum sizes set
        by some filesystems and NFS.  By default, the segment size is a bit
        less than 2Gbytes. When replaying data it is important to keep this in 
        mind, and replay all segments of a run.
    </para>
    <para>
        The Event logger places output files in a specified directory.
        By default, this directory is the working directory at the time the
        application was started.  The default ring from which the program
        accepts data is <literal>tcp://localhost/</literal><replaceable>username</replaceable>
        where <replaceable>username</replaceable> is the name of the user running
        the program.
    </para>
    <para>
        The event log program includes a <option>--oneshot</option> option that
        records a single run and then exits.  The <option>--oneshot</option>
        option also creates synchronization files in the event file directory that
        allow a controlling program to know when the event logger is
        running and when it is about to exit.
    </para>
    <para>
        The control files are:

                    <para>
                        Created when the program is ready to record data.
                        The controlling program can then start a run.

                        any event files to a final directory if desired.

     <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
     <para>
	Records event data verbatim from ring buffers to disk files.
        The program monitors the source ring buffer for a begin run item.
        At that point it opens an event file for that run and begins to record
        data from the ring.  
     </para>
     <para>
        Runs are recorded in files in the target directory.
        Event files are named
        <filename>run-runnumber-segment.evt</filename> where
        <literal>runnumber</literal> is the run number of the run
        taken from the begin run item, <literal>segment</literal> is a file
        segment numbered from zero.
     </para>
     <para>
        Runs are segmented in file that are no larger than a segment size.
        This is done to avoid creating files that are too large for a file system
        to handle or too large for NFS to accurately serve.
     </para>
     <para>
        An option allows the program to be started by a controlling program
        for a single run (e.g. by the readout GUI).
     </para>
     <para>
        Options have sensible defaults.  See OPTIONS below.

	     If present, an SHA512 checksum is computed over the data in each run
	     and output to a file named <filename>run-nnnn.sha512</filename> in the
	     same directory as the event file.  The checksum should match the value
	     that would be produced by the command:
	     <command>sha512sum run-nnnn*.evt</command>

                <para>
                    Indicates to the logger the number of end of run items it should
                    expect to see prior to closing the run.  Once the first end of
                    run is seen, if there is ever a long time without getting any
                    data from the ring source, the logger will complain about a
                    timeout and close the run anyway.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Once <parameter>n</parameter> end of run items are seen in a
                    single run, the run file is closed.  As you might expect,
                    <parameter>n</parameter> must be an integer with a value
                    that is greater than zero.

                    Defines the event source as a Ring buffer Uniform Resource
                    Identifier (URI).  The URI can be for a local or a remote
                    ring buffer.  By default the ring:
                    <literal>tcp://localhost/</literal><replaceable>username</replaceable>
                    where <replaceable>username</replaceable> is the username

                    Provides the path to the directory in which the program will

                <para>

                    When present, the program only records a single run, then

                    when it's ready to record data, and the

	      When present, the <parameter>number</parameter> unconditionally sets
	      the run number for the run.  This requires the <option>--oneshot</option>
	      switch to be present and eventlog will exit with an error if that is not
	      the case.  This switch is intended to be used with a set of event sources
	      that either don't have the concept of a run number or, alternatively,
	      cannot synchronize their run numbers.  The NSCLDAQ-11 readoutGui will
	      use this switch to force the run number of event files created to match the
	      run number in  the ReadoutGUI run number entry.
