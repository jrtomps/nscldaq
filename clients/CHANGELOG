7.4:

- Added program controlpush to push EPICS controls data into tcl server
  programs (e.g. ProductionReadout too).
- Fixed several issues with Production Reaodut's tcl server:
  o Added tcl command error reporting.
  o Correctly handled the case where multiple lines are available on the
    socket.
- ProductionReadout - quote and escape the contents of runvariables and
  statevariables so that arbitrary characters like [ can appear in the
  variable values.
- Framework CSocket::Bind - prior to bind(), enable 
   SO_REUSEADDR to deal with lingering sockets if e.g. readout exits and then
   restarts soon.
- Fix incorrect base address of VME trigger/status module was 0xf000 s.b.
  0x444400 (production readout)
- Fix issue 076: Elapsed time from readout classic is not correct.
- Fix issue 116: Titles, runvars and statevars that don't fit can cause
  a great deal of grief.
- Fix issue 106: Elapsed time from runs is not correct for production rdo.
- Added -rpath on Makefiles for scripted readout and scaler server so user
  does not need to worry about the location of shared libs. Stabilized
  the actual timer trigger so that the latency is unimportant.
- Fix issue 108: Event data files can be overwritten without any prompts.
                 Added to this fix for disabled entry widget poor contrast.
- Put -rpaths in all the Makefiles so we don't need LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  and we always get the right directory.
- Use includes in skeleton makefiles to try to isolate stuff we might modify
  from stuff the user might modify.
- Add a build stamp to the installation procedure.
- Fix incompatibility (bug 121) with Tcl 8.4 for cratelocator.tcl
- Allow plc channels longer to connect in controlpush, and the heck
  with looking for units for them.
- In both controlpush and production readout, add # to the set of 
  characters escaped when writing TCL scripts.
- Added dvdburn product shamelessly stolen from what I did for SEE.
- Support writing tape on a different host than ftp'd to.
- Add design by contract headers (Headers/DesignByContract.h).
  In readout software catch DesignByContractException s that may be thrown
  as a result of user code.
- Issue 112: If sclclient is started with a local data source. Warn using
  X11 if possible or stderr if not.
- VMEPtr.cpp -was ignoring the crate parameter.
- For TCL 8.4 and later it's not so safe to call free(), for stuff
  that came from Tcl_SplitList, better to call Tcl_Free, otherwise I have
  seen segfaults.
- Fix some doxygen errors in Framework.
- CIntConfigParam.cpp - suport unsigned 32 bits as well as signed.
- CCAENModule.cpp - make "waitloops" for data ready adjustable.
- Fix DiskRun stack clobber problem.
- Add -p to tar in Experiment.tcl that creates the ~/experiment/runn dirs.
  otherwise user's umask can modify the output permissions.
- Issue 115: do non-blocked writes to spectcldaq's output pipe, and \
  analyze the returns thoroughly to try to remove the occaisional hung
  spectcldaq process.
- Issue 109 Provide mechanism to hide ReadoutShell's parameters.
- Added support for CAENV1190/1290 TDC module.
  o Correct the bad info about the leading/trailing edge detect Carlo gave me.
- Repair defect 138: Scripted Readout leaks file descriptors.  I had
  had problems getting rid of the old configuration at begin of run and
  had decided to live with the memory leak, but it turns out that also
  leaks file descriptors as module objects stay around and those run out
  first.
- Repair defect 139 - Non numerics in run number cause status line of
  readout gui to blow up.
- Added daqstart program... support starting a program with logging and
  exit notification.
Week of July 26, 2004:
- Added man page for daqstart -> $prefix/man/man1.
- Added daqman command to retrieve daq man-pages.
- Support caennet controllers in any crate number.
Week of August 2, 2004:
- Added support for CES8210's in crates other than 0 for camac.tcl.
