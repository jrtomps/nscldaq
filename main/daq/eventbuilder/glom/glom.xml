        The NSCL event builder is a pipeline.  At the front of the
        pipeline is the fragment orderer. The fragment orderer
        accepts fragments from an arbitrary number of sources, orders them by
        timestamp and emits them in timestamp order.
        If you want events actually built from these sorted fragments, your
        event building pipeline will need an element to glue together fragments
        whose timestamps are within a specified coincidence window, and
        create ring items from them.
    </para>
    <para>
        The program that does this is <application>glom</application>.

    <para>
        Glom accepts fragments on standard input and emits ring items on
        standard output. These may be further processed in later stages of a pipeline
        or they can be piped into <application>stdintoring</application> to
        insert them in a ring buffer for further distribution.

                    as defined in the <filename>fragment.h</filename> header file.
                    The number of fragments is the number required to completely fill
                    the event as determined by the size above.

           <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
           <para>
            Glom is a filter that accepts event ordered event fragments on stdin
            and emits event ring items on standard output.  Event fragments that
            represent non physics triggers are just passed through, with the
            event fragment header stripped off so that they become their initial
            ring items again.
           </para>
           <para>
            Any errors glom wants to complain about are emitted to its standard
            error.  It is therefore normally a bad idea to have glom's standard
            output and standard error pointed to the same sink.
            Glom's behavior is controlled by command line options that are
            documented in <literal>OPTIONS</literal> below.

                            If this option is present, glom won't attempt to glue
                            together event fragments, but will emit each event fragment
                            as a single vent.

                            This mandatory parameter provides the number of
                            timestamp ticks that define a coincidence interval
                            when building events.  The value of <replaceable>ticks</replaceable>
                            is ignored but currently necessary when <option>--nobuild</option>

                        <para>
                            When glom builds output events it builds them with
                            full body headers.  This allows the output of glom to be
                            used as an event source for a subsequent higher level
                            event builder.
                            This option determines what is used
                            for the output timestamp in event body headers.

                            <literal>earliest</literal> is the default and
                            means the timestamp will be filled in with timestamp
                            from the fragment with the smallest timestamp.
                            <literal>latest</literal> means that the timestamp
                            comes from the fragment that has the largest timestamp.
                            <literal>average</literal> means the timestamp is an
                            integerized average of the timstamps of all event
                            fragments in the event.
