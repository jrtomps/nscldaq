## @brief Coordinates the configuration and launching of the different pipelines
#
# This works with the RunstateMachine and its various callout bundles to 
# process a job. A job is defined as a set of the following objects:
# 
# OfflineEVBInputPipeParams
# OfflineEVBHoistPipeParams
# EVBC::AppOptions
# OfflineEVBOutputPipeParams
#
# These each are just structures containing the configuration parameters needed
# to properly set up the variable pipelines. The parameters that they control 
# are not exhaustive but do provide a large set of optional configuration parameters.
#
# The JobProcessor is passed these parameters sets through its options via a
# configure command. It expects that the RunstateMachine and DataSourceManager
# are both clean when it begins. It then fills them with the necessary callout
# bundles and an Offline data providers and registers them to the state machine.
# Beginning a run just amounts to transitioning the state machine to an Active mode.
# Because the user may choose to set up the system to work with multiple jobs, it 
# always cleans up after it is done.
#
