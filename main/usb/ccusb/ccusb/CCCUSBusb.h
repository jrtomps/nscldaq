/*! Controls a Wiener CC-USB connected to localhost

  This class is the low level support for the Wiener/JTEC CCUSB module.
  the CCUSB is a USB CAMAC controller.  To use this class you must first locate
  a module by invoking enumerate.  enumerate  returns a vector of
  usb_device*s.   One of those can be used to instantiate the CCCUSBusb 
  object which can the ben operated on.

  Most all of the functionality is implemented in te base class CCCUSB. 
  The methods defined in this class are the minimum needed to be implemented
  in order to attach to a locally connected usb device (i.e. the usb device
  is directly connected to the computer).
