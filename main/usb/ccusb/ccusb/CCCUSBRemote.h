/**
 *  This class provides remote access to the VM-USB through the
 *  VMUSBModule support in the tcl server.
 *  An external program can link to libVMUSBRemote.so, instantiate
 *  this class and pretty much have its way with the VM-USB
 *  as if it owned it.  
 *  Restrictions:
 *   - lists cannot be downloaded (only immediate lists can be run).
 *   - the action register is not accessible.
 *   - The IRQ Mask cannot be written as that abomination requires 
 *     action register operations
 *   - while internal registers can be manipulated be aware that
 *     # This may cuase an active readout to have undefined results.
 *     # Registers you write may be overwritten by Readout's startup 
 *     # code.
